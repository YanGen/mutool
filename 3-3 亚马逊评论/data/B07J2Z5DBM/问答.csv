B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,0,5,"I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.","我对Tozo T10印象深刻。包装令人难以置信，建造质量是一流的，一套惊人的功能，即使价格是两倍高的价格。无线充电、IPX8防水、高质量的8mm声音驱动程序和蓝牙v5.0只是T10必须提供的高端功能中的一部分，将它们与我的手机配对太容易了。你只需要把它们从充电箱里拿出来，就可以配对了（只需简单地说一句，确保你选择ZO-T10-R，右耳塞是主要的）。蓝牙v5.0意味着他们有更强的连接和更长的距离。我可以把它们放在我的背包里，我仍然可以连接到30英尺远的地方。高音的清晰度和低音的丰满度都是最高端耳塞的品质水平。我个人把这些带进了淋浴间，我当时并没有洗澡，耳塞和手机壳本身都是非常防水的。我惊喜地发现，我可以用我的T10手机充电四个多小时，而且充电箱可以为耳塞充电四次。最后，我要说的是，齐无线充电箱非常方便。我可以把手机和耳塞套放在我的充电板上，我可以走了。如果你从未使用过无线充电，你需要。总之，我在市场上找不到比这更好的耳塞了。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,0,5,"Every Christmas I usually have enough personal money to make an impulse purchase, usually in Electronics. This year, I wanted to upgrade the $20 pair of totally wireless sound (TWS) earbuds I had. They were good, but needed better sound to make them perfect.With a budget of about $100, I started off looking for something good from a known manufacturer (like Samsung, Jabra, etc.) There was just nothing out there in my price range. I couldn't see myself paying that kind of money from a brand I didn't know, so I started looking for a cheaper model. For around $50 I found 3-4 that looked good and reviews were good enough. I liked Anker's other Bluetooth earphones, so the Soundcore Liberty Lites were considered. With the good reviews and previous good ownership of Monoprice products the Monoprice IPX4s were looking good, too.Due diligence and a desire to be able to use one earbud at a time drive me to search Amazon's best rated under $50 TWS sets, and Tozo looked pretty good. While the buds are labeled L and R, they are both the same, and can be put into either ear. They come with 4 tips, and for the first time, I'm not using the largest ones. So if you have really big ear canals and find it hard to get tips that fit, you may find a good fit here.The sound won't knock Bose out of the water, but for the forty dollars I paid, it is good, and an outstanding upgrade from my $20 pair. It has nice bass, and well defined mids and highs.Battery time is right around 4 hours at low volume (I wear them at work as background noise). The travel case can charge one while the other is playing, so I don't find it hard to get through a work day with them. I like the charging case, too. It's well built, and can use a Qi wireless charger, which I don't care about really. There are 4 lights to tell you how charged it is. it closes and fits in a pocket. I can't tell you how many charges it will take, because I usually keep it plugged in.Pairing, once initially done, is easy. Just pull a bud off the charger and it will turn on and start looking for your paired device. Since I'm using one at a time, I find I need to turn the one I'm using off completely first, then get the other one. I paired them first together, and then separate. This is the best part of these for me, almost seamless use.All in all, very happy with the purchase. And I save up some money to get something else. I have already recommended these to people (my brother is not convinced, he has bone conducting headphones he likes). I do like them that much.","每年圣诞节，我通常都有足够的个人资金来进行冲动购买，通常是在电子产品领域。今年，我想升级20美元的全无线耳机。它们很好，但需要更好的声音才能使它们完美。预算约为100美元，我开始从一家知名制造商（如三星、雅布拉等）那里寻找一些好东西，但在我的价格范围内什么都没有。我看不到自己从一个我不知道的品牌那里花了那么多钱，所以我开始寻找一个更便宜的型号。50美元左右，我发现3-4看起来不错，评论也不错。我喜欢Anker的其他蓝牙耳机，所以考虑了Soundcore Liberty Lite。由于对Monoprice产品的良好评价和之前的良好所有权，Monoprice IPX4看起来也不错。尽职调查和一次只能使用一个耳塞的愿望驱使我搜索亚马逊最好的50美元以下的TWS套件，而Tozo看起来相当不错。当花蕾被标记为L和R时，它们都是一样的，并且可以放在两个耳朵里。它们有4个提示，我第一次不用最大的。所以如果你的耳道真的很大，很难找到合适的建议，你可能会在这里找到一个合适的。声音不会把Bose从水中打掉，但是我花了40美元，就很好了，而且比我20美元的一双升级得更好。它有很好的低音，清晰的中高音。在低音量下，电池时间大约为4小时（我在工作时戴着它们作为背景噪音）。旅行箱可以一边玩一边收费，所以我觉得和他们一起度过一个工作日并不难。我也喜欢充电箱。它的结构很好，可以使用一个Qi无线充电器，我真的不在乎。有4盏灯可以告诉你它的充电情况。它合上放在口袋里。我不能告诉你需要多少费用，因为我通常会把它插上电源。配对，一旦开始，很容易。只需拔下充电器的一个花蕾，它就会打开并开始寻找配对的设备。因为我一次使用一个，我发现我需要先完全关闭正在使用的那个，然后再使用另一个。我先把它们配对，然后分开。这对我来说是最好的一部分，几乎是无缝使用。总之，很高兴购买。我存了点钱去买别的东西。我已经把这些推荐给人们了（我弟弟不相信，他有他喜欢的骨导耳机）。我真的很喜欢他们。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,923,5,"i purchased the TOZO T10 wireless earbuds to workout in the pool as they were one of the few IPX8 sets available and definitely the most reasonable.  For the price, i didnt expect that much, but I was blown away by the sound quality.... crystal clear with velvety bass tones.  Reception distance was really good, there was no loss in quality at the far end of the pool.  Good to know that if I accidentally drop one in the water or it were to fall out of my ear, I can scoop it back up and keep going.  But it is doubtful that will happen as the fit is tight but comfortable. Very pleased with my purchase.  The only negative thing about this buying these is that my husband is impressed as well, so it looks like I will have to buy another pair for him to use while he is out on his kayak.  He isn't getting mine. :-)","我买了TOZO T10无线耳塞在泳池里锻炼，因为它们是为数不多的IPX8套件之一，绝对是最合理的。价格方面，我没想到会有那么高，但音质让我大吃一惊。。。。水晶般清澈，天鹅绒般的低音。接待距离真的很好，泳池的远端没有质量损失。很高兴知道如果我不小心把一个掉到水里或者它从我的耳朵里掉了出来，我可以把它舀回去继续走。但这是怀疑会发生的，因为适合是紧的，但舒适。对我的购买非常满意。买这双鞋唯一的坏处就是我丈夫也印象深刻，所以看来我得再给他买一双，让他在皮划艇上使用。他没有得到我的。:-)

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,689,5,"I absolutely love these earbuds!  I was looking at Samsung's offering since I just upgraded to a Note 9.  However,  the Tozo earbuds had much better reviews and are $100 cheaper.In the box:Very good packaging2 wireless earbuds clearly labeled for left and right.1 charging case1 pair of the smaller rubber covers and a pair of larger ones in addition to the ones included on the earbuds themselves.A 1 year extended warranty card (must activate within 14 days of receipt) - easy process using the provided car code!Detailed instructionsThe earbuds pair quickly and easily to each other and to my Note 9 with voice prompts letting you know when each is paired.  You also get a voice notification for incoming calls and when hanging up a call.The buttons are pretty tactile, however you do have to give them a bit of force.  This does help in mitigating erroneous button presses though.The earbuds fit my ears out of the box but come with various sizes so you can get the perfect fit for you.I haven't done a complete workout with these but I have worn them for hours during moderate activity and they haven't fallen out of my ears.The battery life is amazing!  I've used these for hours and they only got down to 80%.  The case conveniently charges the earbuds when they're not in use and I've only had to charge the case once after a few days use.The case itself is a little on the large side but I'll take that trade off for the amazing battery life it delivers! Although I can comfortably carry these in my pocket (I'm 6'3 and have deep Jean pockets), most might opt to carry these in a gym or laptop bag.The sound quality is decent given the price with lots of bass although I usually prefer a ""flat"" signal.  However,  I use the PI music app from the Play store which has a decent EQ so I just flatten out the signal there.  You'll definitely want to be careful not to listen to these with the volume cranked all the way up as they can get pretty loud.The range is top notch!  I think I read these are supposed to work up to 10 meters away from the paired device but I've gone further without any drop in reception.These earbuds are rated IPX8 which means they can get wet but you don't want to submerge them in water.  I've had these on in the rain with no issues.Overall,  you won't be disappointed with your purchase!  These are high quality wireless earbuds! Enjoy your music and your savings!","我绝对喜欢这些耳塞！我在看三星的产品，因为我刚刚升级到一个注9。不过，Tozo耳塞的评价要好得多，而且价格便宜100美元。包装盒内：非常好的包装2个无线耳塞，左右两侧都有清晰的标签。1个充电箱1对较小的橡胶盖和一对较大的，除了耳塞本身的外。一张1年的延长保修卡（必须在14年内激活收到日期）-使用提供的汽车代码轻松处理！详细说明耳塞可以快速轻松地配对，我的注释9中有语音提示，让您知道每一个耳塞何时配对。当你接到来电或挂断电话时，你也会收到语音通知。这些按钮触感很好，但是你必须给它们一点力量。不过，这确实有助于减少误按按钮的情况。耳塞适合我的耳朵，但大小不一，这样你就可以得到最适合你的耳塞。我还没有用这些耳塞做过完整的锻炼，但我在适度活动中戴了好几个小时，它们还没有从我的耳朵里掉出来。电池寿命惊人！我已经用了好几个小时了，它们只降到了80%。当耳塞不在使用的时候，它可以方便地为耳塞充电，而且我只需要在使用几天后为它充电一次。耳塞本身有点大，但我会用它提供的惊人的电池寿命来换取它！虽然我可以很舒服地把这些放在口袋里（我6尺3寸，有很深的牛仔裤口袋），但大多数人可能会选择把它们放在健身房或笔记本电脑包里。考虑到有很多低音的价格，音质还算不错，尽管我通常更喜欢“平”的信号。不过，我使用的是来自Play store的PI音乐应用程序，它有一个不错的EQ，所以我只是把那里的信号调平。你一定要小心，不要把音量一直调高，因为它们会变得很响。范围是一流的！我想我读到的这些耳塞应该在离配对设备10米远的地方工作，但是我没有任何接收信号下降。这些耳塞的等级是IPX8，这意味着它们可能会被弄湿，但你不想把它们浸入水中。我在雨中买的这些没有问题。总的来说，你不会对你的购买感到失望！这些是高品质的无线耳塞！享受你的音乐和存款吧！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,585,5,I'm quite happy with my new TOZO T10 so far.  The sound quality is great and the bass is good which was my biggest concern when searching for the best ones on Amazon. I'm glad a lot of reviewers mentioned about the bass quality.  It's good but not as good as my corded Scosche earyphones that i've been enjoying for years.  Then again without having the cord is wonderful and an excellent trade off.  Longer will I have to struggle with the cord getting caught on the workout machines at the gym.  Just only had it for 2 days and so far so good.  Not sure about the battery life yet so i've given it 4 stars but may renew my review later.  This being my first time with a wireless earbuds I have to say i'm pretty pleased with everything so far. I would recommend this as it is a reasonable price for what it is.,"到目前为止，我对我的新款TOZO T10相当满意。音质很好，低音很好，这是我在亚马逊搜索最好的音质时最担心的。我很高兴很多评论家提到了低音的质量。它很好，但不如我多年来一直喜欢的那种带绳的烤饼耳机。再没有绳子是一个很好的交换。我还要花更长的时间才能在健身房的健身器材上挣扎。只吃了两天就好了。还不确定电池的寿命，所以我已经给了它4星，但可能会更新我的审查后。这是我第一次用无线耳机，我不得不说我对目前为止的一切都很满意。我推荐这个，因为这是一个合理的价格。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,533,5,"I researched Bluetooth earbuds for several weeks.  There are so many options and so many claims.  Reading the reviews and questions on this product, I decided to give them a try.  They had EVERYTHING that I wanted in wireless earbuds.  I wanted great sound, a charging case that could be charged with USB as well as being charged on a wireless charger, the option of using just one earbud (left or right) for phone calls, great usage time, quick charge time and good range.  Also, as with any purchase I make, I look for Seller feedback when there is a problem or defect.  These earbuds check everything on my list.  I have put them through the gambit and they met or exceeded my expectations.  They easily connect to my iPhone XR.  They effortlessly connect to each other for really good stereo sound.  They have a range of 30-35 feet in my home.  You can use the Left or Right earbud by itself.  They have a very good length of charge.  Although I don't listen to music all day long (so I can't comment on the length of time they will stay charged for a whole day of music), but I have listened to a couple of hours and used for phone calls all day long and didn't need to recharge them.  They are extremely comfortable.  I have gone to bed and discovered that I still had one in my ear.  The only problem I have had with them is that I have extremely small ear canals.  I had to purchase a set of XS ear tips (SpinFit CP100-SS 3.8mm here on Amazon).  This is no slight to these earbuds though, most people will be completely satisfied with the multiple sizes provided with the earbuds.  I would and have recommended this product to everyone.","我研究了几个星期的蓝牙耳机。有这么多的选择和这么多的要求。读了关于这个产品的评论和问题，我决定试一试。他们有我想要的无线耳机。我想要很棒的声音，一个可以用USB充电的充电箱，也可以用无线充电器充电，可以选择只使用一个耳塞（左或右）打电话，很好的使用时间，很快的充电时间和范围。此外，与我所做的任何购买一样，当有问题或缺陷时，我会寻找卖家的反馈。这些耳塞检查我名单上的所有东西。我已经让他们通过了这个游戏，他们达到或超过了我的期望。它们很容易连接到我的iPhone XR。他们毫不费力地相互连接，获得真正好的立体声效果。他们在我家有30-35英尺的范围。你可以自己用左耳或右耳。它们的充电时间很长。虽然我不整天听音乐（所以我不能评论他们一整天的音乐收费时间的长短），但我听了几个小时的音乐，整天都在打电话，不需要给他们充电。它们非常舒适。我已经上床睡觉了，发现我耳朵里还有一个。我唯一的问题是我的耳道非常小。我不得不购买一套XS耳尖（SpinFit CP100-SS 3.8毫米，亚马逊网站）。不过，这对这些耳塞来说并不小，大多数人都会对耳塞提供的多种尺寸感到完全满意。我会向所有人推荐这个产品。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,534,5,"UPDATE:TOZO is sending a new set to see if the right channel was the problem. They are trying very hard to please me, including offering a full refund (return unnecessary). I opted to try the new buds because I really like the sound and how well they stay in my ears.----------------TOZO sent me a new left channel earbud when I told them about the problem with it dropping out. Only took a week to get the new one! After resetting the earbuds according to their directions, the newly reset left channel continued to drop out like the old one. It's possible that the problem is with the right bud, but they only sent the left. Most likely it's a bad design that only works for some people in some environments.After some research it would appear that it is rare for bluetooth headphones to work right all the time, so Tozo is not unique in this aspect. I've read that Bose makes some that work, but the reviews on Amazon belie that. Since I own a set of Apple AirPods, and they work great, I know it's possible to design something that functions properly, electronically (AirPods slip out and are not water resistant).There are several reasons why wireless earbuds might drop out on the left channel, but all revolve around the signal. Bluetooth transmits the left and right channels to the right bud (master), and then the right bud sends the left channel to the left bud (slave) via another bluetooth channel. Since most heads tend to attenuate the signal, very little signal gets through skin, skull, brain, and blood. It's better to get the antennas outside the ear so the signal can go around the head, so to speak. I suspect Apple figured that out and put the antenna in that little stem that hangs out of the ear.It's sad that these TOZO earbuds don't work worth a darn since they sound rather good for bluetooth audio from an MP3 file, and wireless bluetooth is so convenient when out running, cycling, etc. So now it's back to the Apple AirPods that slip out of my ears. Ugh!","更新：TOZO正在发送一个新的集合，看看是否是正确的频道出了问题。他们正在努力取悦我，包括提供全额退款（不需要退货）。我选择尝试新的耳塞，因为我真的很喜欢它的声音和它们在我耳朵里的感觉。―――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――。只花了一个星期就拿到新的！在根据耳塞的方向重新设置耳塞后，新设置的左声道继续像旧的一样脱落。有可能是右芽出了问题，但他们只派左芽。很可能这是一个糟糕的设计，只适用于某些环境中的某些人。经过一些研究，似乎蓝牙耳机很少能一直正常工作，所以Tozo在这方面并不独特。我读过Bose做了一些有用的东西，但是亚马逊的评论却不这么认为。因为我有一套苹果AirPods，而且它们工作得很好，所以我知道可以设计一些功能正常的电子产品（AirPods滑出，不防水）。无线耳机可能会从左声道掉出来，但都是围绕信号的。蓝牙将左声道和右声道传输到右声道（主），然后右声道通过另一个蓝牙声道将左声道发送到左声道（从）。由于大多数头部倾向于减弱信号，很少有信号通过皮肤、头骨、大脑和血液。可以说，最好把天线放在耳朵外面，这样信号就可以绕过头部。我怀疑苹果公司发现了这一点，并把天线放在了挂在耳朵外面的那根小茎上。很遗憾，这些TOZO耳塞根本不管用，因为它们听起来很适合MP3文件中的蓝牙音频，而且无线蓝牙在外出跑步、骑自行车等时也很方便。所以现在又回到了苹果的AirPods上，它从耳朵里滑了出来我的耳朵。啊！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,577,5,"My previous set of bluetooth headphones had lost their ability to hold a charge, so I looked at buying new ones. I was only looking for something which would have decent sound quality and reasonable isolation, and something which would have better battery life. These were on sale, so I decided to give them a try.Not only do these fit incredibly comfortably, but the sound quality is very good. There's a tiny amount of background hiss (as is typical for actively powered headphones) but it's low enough that it doesn't interfere with my enjoyment of the music, and it does serve a purpose in letting me know they're turned on.The controls on the earbuds themselves could be a little better; I wish there were some way of controlling the volume and skipping music tracks, but it only has play/pause and an assortment of call controls.Unlike my previous earbuds, these don't play an audio indication whenever the music track changes, which is good (that was really annoying). Rather than playing little jingles on connect/disconnect, a voice speaks in English. I'd rather have a little tone but the voice prompts are pretty okay too.I also tried recording a voice memo using the microphone, and while the signal level was a bit low (meaning I might come through a bit quietly on a phone call) the sound quality was fine, and surprising considering the microphone is physically in my ear. It might have trouble dealing with background noise. We'll see.The little charging/carrying case is nicely designed. It's a bit big compared to the Apple AirPods, but it has enough battery to charge the earbuds 4 times, and it also itself can be charged wirelessly or via USB. Which is something the AirPods still can't do.All in all these are great little earbuds and are well worth the money. Even at their normal price they're orders of magnitudes less expensive than the AirPods or the Jabra Elite 65t, too.","我以前的蓝牙耳机已经失去了充电能力，所以我考虑买新的。我只想找一些有良好的音质和合理的隔音效果，以及一些电池寿命更好的东西。这些是特价的，所以我决定试一试，不仅合身舒适，而且音质也很好。有少量的背景嘶嘶声（这是主动式耳机的典型特征），但它足够低，不会影响我对音乐的欣赏，而且它确实有一个目的，就是让我知道它们已经打开了。耳塞上的控制装置本身可能会好一点；我希望有某种方法可以控制音量跳过音乐曲目，但它只有播放/暂停和各种呼叫控制。与我以前的耳塞不同，这些耳塞在音乐曲目改变时不会播放音频指示，这很好（真的很烦人）。语音不是在连接/断开连接时播放小铃声，而是用英语说话。我宁愿有一点音调，但语音提示也很好。我还试着用麦克风录制语音备忘，虽然信号电平有点低（意味着我可能会在电话中安静地通过），但音质很好，而且考虑到麦克风在我的耳朵里，令人惊讶。它可能无法处理背景噪音。我们拭目以待。这个小小的充电/携带箱设计得很好。与苹果AirPods相比，它有点大，但它有足够的电池为耳塞充电4次，而且它本身也可以通过无线或USB充电。这是AirPods仍然做不到的事情。所有这些都是伟大的小耳塞，非常值得钱。即使按正常价格，它们的数量级也比AirPods或Jabra Elite 65t便宜。

Buy with confidence.,"这更多的是一个负面评论的更新，我的第一对耳塞不会和我的任何苹果设备保持连接。当生活让我忙得不可开交的时候，退货是件痛苦的事，但我不得不这样做。现在，卖家联系我讨论这个问题。他们控制住了，迅速更换了耳塞，没有任何麻烦和问题。他们的客户支持肯定是一流的。现在-耳塞已经启动并运行。他们携带良好的音质，很容易与我的所有设备配对。它们有不同大小的提示，以获得最佳的舒适度。我不确定电池的续航时间，但到目前为止还不算太差。就价格而言，这些东西都很好。他们的客户服务承担了购买的所有烦恼。自信地购买。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,260,5,"Initially I was having trouble getting the earbuds to fit properly; they were sticking out where they should have been more flush with my ear opening…  After a few attempts I finally got them in right, (see bottom row of image) but it was a challenge at first; helped to stand in front of a mirror. Once you get it right it makes sense and is a snap to fit. It was my first set of Bluetooth earbuds so it was on a steep learning curve to figure it all out at once.Trying all the different sized tips (included) was useful, finally settled on the medium sized ones with good results. I found that learning to put the buds in, in front of a mirror at first was helpful, as was licking the tips for lubrication made the task easier. It takes a simple rotation of the bud to the back that locks the bud in the right position. Once you get it right and see how it fits, it gets easier.The sound is surprisingly very good quality and with good base. If it sounds too thin & tinny initially, it’s a sign that the buds are not properly positioned in the ear.I tried all the included rubber-tip fittings and settled in on the medium. The directions are ambiguous at times and I don’t know if something was lost in the translation, but it easy to figure out and they have a very responsive support team. I contacted them and was linked to several pages and videos that were very helpful.I like the product and can now listen to my Kindle books without disturbing others. Connecting with iPhone/iPad was easy. The charging unit is small enough to carry in my pocket and comes with a lanyard so you can hang around your neck. Nice little compact unit.All in all a nice addition to my pile of technology... :)","最初，我很难让耳塞合身；耳塞伸出的地方应该与我的耳朵张开时更齐平……几次尝试后，我终于把它们插对了（见图片的下一行），但一开始这是一个挑战；帮助我站在镜子前。一旦你做对了，这是有意义的，是一个很快适应。这是我的第一套蓝牙耳机，所以它在一个陡峭的学习曲线上一下子把所有的问题都解决了。尝试所有不同大小的耳塞（包括耳塞）是有用的，最后决定使用中等大小的耳塞，效果很好。我发现，一开始在镜子前学会把花蕾放进去是很有帮助的，因为舔一下花蕾的润滑油可以使任务更容易。它需要一个简单的旋转芽到后面，锁定芽在正确的位置。一旦你把它弄对了，看看它如何适合，它就变得容易多了。声音的质量出奇的好，基础也很好。如果一开始听起来太薄，太刺耳，那说明耳塞在耳朵里的位置不对。我试了所有附带的橡胶头配件，然后放在中间。方向有时模棱两可，我不知道翻译过程中是否丢失了什么，但很容易弄清楚，他们有一个反应灵敏的支持团队。我联系了他们，并链接到了一些非常有用的页面和视频，我喜欢这个产品，现在可以在不打扰别人的情况下收听我的Kindle书籍。连接iPhone/iPad很容易。充电装置很小，可以放在我的口袋里，还配有一根绳子，这样你就可以挂在脖子上了。很好的小型设备。在我那堆技术的基础上又增加了一个。。。:)

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: WHITE,253,5,"First of all, I have spent approx. 2 hrs over the past 2 weeks looking for some wireless earbuds that were reasonably priced, and actually had real reviews.  Each time I would give up out of frustration of all the fraud in the reviews on these products..  For some reason, everytime I though I found a good set up earbuds I would look into approx. 10 reviews to see if the count and star rating was real. some of the other products actually had reviews that were for a completely different product... weird trick.  But consistently I would find a high number of fake reviews.. clearly fake.. note they typically have one review.. OR if they do have multiple reviews you will see they did them all within a couple days for cheap items.  This was the only product with a high review sample size and I couldn't find any evidence in my sampling of fake reviews.  So don't believe me, actually go in and look at a bunch of reviews for this product and see for yourself.  All I would find was reviewers with high review count, many years.. So hard to fake.  I had one other set of earbuds that looked huge, had tinny sound.  SO after my long search and finding these... I am so happy.  I just received them 2 hours ago, so excited had to do a review.  I got the white ones, Sound is excellent, bass is just right, I wouldn't say too much, or too little.. just right.- But yes it does have bass so my songs actually sound like I wanted them to.  Comes with different size earbuds sleeves... I though smaller would be better … but actually found the slightly larger sleeves were best fit, they won't fall out.  Super happy with these, search is over.  One other point is these don't look dorky big in my ears, like the previous ones I tried.  I don't know if noise cancellation is working or not.. hard to tell.. I couldn't hear the TV in the room practically at all so maybe it is working.. OR its just the earbud is blocking my ear canal.. either way sounds great.  Distance is great too, I have walked 50ft away and into my garage.. only there did it start to go choppy, but was going through firedoor and wall.  Plus says there waterproof on box.. I like that for when I exercise..  Great product you will be happy..  I'm glad this seller didn't go dishonest with the reviews like all the other earbuds.  I wish amazon would do sampling of reviews by dishonest dealers and cut them out!, rather them leave me to waste my time figuring it out.7-1-19 One update on my review.  I talked about noise cancellation.  I went and used them for working out.  Found there is really no noise cancellation.  I could still hear the music and noise around when working out, but not bad.. BUT I still love the product.  In fairness I looked again and the manufacturer didn't say there is active noise cancellation, They only mentioned something to the equalivant of noise blocking.. I.E. since there is plugs in your ear canal.  So Still very happy with my purchase.  IF you are looking for active noise cancelling.. these don't have that.  BUT still the Best earbuds I could find on Amazon for a good low price.","首先，在过去的两周里，我花了大约2个小时寻找一些价格合理的无线耳塞，并且得到了真正的评价。每次我都会因为对这些产品的审查中所有的欺诈行为感到沮丧而放弃。。出于某种原因，每次我发现一个好的耳塞，我会查看大约10个评论，看看计数和星级是真的。其他一些产品的评论实际上是针对完全不同的产品。。。诡计。但一直以来，我都会发现大量的虚假评论。。显然是假的。。注意他们通常有一个评论。。或者如果他们有多个评论，你会看到他们在几天内都做了便宜的项目。这是唯一一个审查样本量高的产品，我在假审查的抽样中找不到任何证据。所以不要相信我，其实进去看看这个产品的一堆评论，自己看看。我所能找到的只是那些有着很高评价数的评论者，很多年。。很难伪造。我还有一副耳塞，看起来很大，声音很轻。所以经过我长时间的搜寻和发现。。。我很高兴。我两个小时前才收到，所以兴奋得做了一个回顾。我有白色的，声音很好，低音很好，我不会说太多，或者说太少。。很好。-但是是的，它有低音，所以我的歌听起来像是我想要的。配有不同尺寸的耳塞套。。。我觉得小一点会更好…但实际上发现稍微大一点的袖子最合适，不会掉出来。很高兴看到这些，搜索结束了。另一点是，这些在我的耳朵里看起来并不像以前那样大。我不知道噪音消除是否有效。。很难说。。我几乎听不到房间里的电视，所以也许它在工作。。或者只是耳塞堵住了我的耳道。。不管怎样听起来都不错。距离也太远了，我已经走了50英尺，进了我的车库。。只有在那里，它开始变得波涛汹涌，但正在通过防火门和墙壁。加上盒子上有防水的。。我喜欢当我锻炼的时候。。很好的产品你会很高兴的。。我很高兴这个卖家没有像其他所有的耳塞一样对评论不诚实。我希望亚马逊能对不诚实的经销商的评论进行抽样，并将其剔除！相反，他们让我浪费时间去搞清楚。7-1-19我的评论有一个更新。我说了噪音消除。我去用它们锻炼身体。发现真的没有噪音消除。我在锻炼时仍然能听到周围的音乐和噪音，但还不错。。但我还是喜欢这个产品。公平地说，我又看了一遍，制造商没有说有主动消音，他们只是提到了一些与消音相同的东西。。一、 因为你的耳道里有耳塞。所以对我的购买还是很满意的。如果你正在寻找主动噪声抵消。。这些没有。但我还是能在亚马逊上找到最好的耳塞，而且价格便宜。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,249,5,"I purchased these to listen to music or audio books on my walking commutes. They have never died on me, and my walk is 80 minutes - which is more than I can say for the last BT earbuds I had. I like the earbud receptacle/battery charger case. I not really impressed with the noise cancellation, but that's not a big deal for me (I've read that NC is primarily designed to cancel jet engine noise, and doesn't handle a wide variety of random frequencies well - what I experience walking home with traffic). These also stay in my ear better than the last set I had, which would fall out when I ran (it not fun trying to find the little buggers). They sound fine to me, but I'm not an audiophile and have some high frequency hearing, so I'm not a good judge of audio quality. I would purchase these again.","我买这些是为了在步行途中听音乐或听有声读物。他们从未在我身上死去，我的步行时间是80分钟――这比我最后一次戴上BT耳塞的时间还长。我喜欢耳塞插座/电池充电器。我对噪音消除并没有太大的印象，但这对我来说并不是什么大不了的（我读到NC主要是为了消除喷气发动机的噪音，并且不能很好地处理各种各样的随机频率――我在交通拥挤的情况下步行回家的体验）。这些也比我上次的那套更好地留在我的耳朵里，那套在我跑的时候会掉出来（想找到那些小虫子可不好玩）。他们听起来不错，但我不是一个爱听者，有一些高频听力，所以我不是一个好的判断音频质量。我想再买一次。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,252,5,"FINAL UPDATE (#2):  I am updating this review after getting to examine a 3rd pair of earbuds and finding that they were completely trouble free.  I have kept all previous reviews below for completeness sake.  Quick version:  I got a bad pair, but I was quickly sent a replacement, and have used a 3rd pair.  The 2nd and 3rd pair worked flawlessly (the first pair were clearly not the “normal” quality) so I feel compelled to update my review based on this.  I also discovered that if you have a wireless charger (like one you use with your phone), you can rest the charging case on that wireless charging pad and they charge!  That’s so convenient.  I am also finding them to be very comfortable and I enjoy the sound.  Great for the gym!UPDATE 1:  TOZO contacted me by email and sent me a new pair of earbuds.  These earbuds indeed work fine and don't have any issues at all.  I think TOZO understands the importance of reviews and very much wants people to give them good reviews.  I would say they are even a bit aggressive about their customer service. They were always incredibly polite and professional, but they wanted to be sure I got the second pair to try.  I can appreciate their hard work in trying to make sure that I walked away with good things to say about the product.  I have now given this 4 stars because the final product works great, but the fact that I got one that seems to be way too susceptible to interference won't allow me to give it 5 stars in good conscience.Bottom line:- first product worked well except for drops - but they were so frequent in certain places it was maddening- second product worked like a charm and does not seem to have any of the dropping issues- they want to be sure you are happy so the customer service was lightning fast and with no questions asked- If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive pair of Bluetooth wireless earbuds, give these a try.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  They pair easily, have a nice charging case, and seem to have a good battery life.  Unfortunately, they drop signal 3-4xs per minute.  I did a bit of troubleshooting to make sure it was the earbuds and not the device.  I paired it with several devices and the earbuds always dropped signal.  I then paired all of the devices with several other bluetooth headphones and speakers I have (including an Echo).  All of the devices played flawlessly through all of the speakers without dropping signal.  However, these drop regularly.  Sometimes it will go for a minute or two without dropping, sometimes certain places seem to make it worse, but, overall, it happens several times per minute.  It makes an otherwise decent pair of earbuds unusable.  I will return these.","最后更新（#2）：我在检查了第三对耳塞并发现它们完全没有问题之后更新了这篇评论。为了完整起见，我保留了之前所有的评论。快速版本：我得到了一个坏的对，但我很快被派了一个替代品，并使用了第三对。第二对和第三对完美无瑕（第一对显然不是“正常”的质量），所以我觉得有必要在此基础上更新我的评论。我还发现，如果你有一个无线充电器（像一个你用你的手机），你可以把充电箱放在那个无线充电垫上，他们充电！太方便了。我也发现他们非常舒适，我喜欢的声音。很适合健身房！更新1:TOZO通过电子邮件联系我，给我发了一副新耳塞。这些耳塞确实工作良好，没有任何问题。我认为TOZO理解评论的重要性，非常希望人们给他们好的评论。我想说的是，他们在客户服务方面甚至有点咄咄逼人。他们总是非常礼貌和专业，但他们想确保我有第二双试试。我可以感谢他们的辛勤工作，以确保我离开了好东西说的产品。我现在给了这4颗星，因为最终的产品效果很好，但事实上，我得到了一个似乎太容易受到干扰的方式，不允许我给它5星级的良心。底线：-第一个产品工作良好，除了滴-但他们是如此频繁，在某些地方，这是令人抓狂-第二个产品工作像一个魅力，似乎没有任何下降的问题-他们想确定你是快乐的，所以客户服务是闪电般的快，没有问题问-如果你正在寻找一对相对便宜的蓝牙无线耳塞，给这些试试。原始评论：他们很容易配对，有一个很好的充电箱，似乎有一个很好的电池寿命。不幸的是，信号每分钟下降3-4倍。我做了一些故障排除，以确保是耳塞而不是设备。我把它和几个设备配对，耳塞总是发出信号。然后我将所有设备与其他蓝牙耳机和扬声器配对（包括回声）。所有的设备在所有的扬声器中完美地播放，没有信号丢失。然而，这些下降是有规律的。有时它会持续一两分钟而没有下降，有时某些地方似乎使情况更糟，但总的来说，它每分钟发生几次。这使得一对原本体面的耳塞无法使用。我会还给你的。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,278,5,"I'll be completely honest: I did not expect anything amazing from these earbuds. In fact, I was entirely prepared to receive them, use them for a day, and send them back due to poor quality.I was happily mistaken.The Pros: Right out of the box, these earbuds looked impressive. The housings on each earpiece have a matte, somewhat tacky (in terms of texture), black finish that feels really nice. Each earbud feels light yet sturdy. There are 4 included rubber earpieces included (the medium size is attached by default). The earbuds pair automatically when taken out of the housing. The sound on these is incredible! When situated properly in the ear, these things pump out a decent layer of bass and produce a surprising clear range of mids and highs! The buds pair automatically when removed from the case, and I have yet to experience any static while listening. They also have an excellent range, and you can even keep them on while you take a shower/bath! The most satisfying part of this purchase was the $31 price tag. I'm struggling to include all of the positive aspects of these earbuds in one review!The Cons: I'm not sure I can think of any at the moment! My only gripe would be that the earbuds don't remain completely in the ear when you start to move around, particularly while running/dancing. When this happens, the sound quality is noticeably reduced (since they start to fall out).Pictured are the XL, L and S earpieces (in that order) as well as all included accessories. The M earpieces are attached to the earbuds.*Note: I have yet to really test the limits of the battery life on these. I will update my review at a later date.","我会说实话：我没想到这些耳塞会有什么惊人的效果。事实上，我完全准备好了接收它们，使用一天，然后由于质量差而将它们寄回去。我很高兴弄错了。优点：这些耳塞在开箱即用的时候看起来令人印象深刻。每个听筒的外壳都有一个哑光，有点俗气（就质地而言），黑色的表面，感觉真的很好。每个耳塞感觉轻而结实。包括4个橡胶听筒（默认情况下为中等尺寸）。耳塞从外罩中取出时会自动配对。上面的声音真不可思议！当正确地放置在耳朵，这些东西泵出一个体面的低音层，并产生一个令人惊讶的中高音清晰范围！当从箱子里取出时，芽会自动配对，而我在听的时候还没有经历过任何静电。它们的射程也很好，你甚至可以在洗澡的时候一直戴着！这次购买最令人满意的部分是31美元的标价。我正在努力把这些耳塞的所有积极方面都包括在一篇评论中！缺点：我不确定我现在能想到什么！我唯一的抱怨是，当你开始走动时，尤其是在跑步/跳舞时，耳塞不会完全留在耳朵里。当这种情况发生时，音质明显降低（因为它们开始脱落）。图中是XL、L和S耳机（按顺序排列）以及所有附带的配件。M耳机与耳塞相连。*注意：我还没有真正测试这些耳机的电池寿命限制。我稍后会更新我的评论。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,248,5,"I've been using ""wireless"" earbuds for the last few years, and although they're more convenient than wired ones the fact that they still are connected to each other with a wire pretty much still makes them a bit ""in the way."" I loved the idea of the AirPods being truly wireless and having a secure storage case that charges the earbuds but I didn't like the design of the earbuds themselves or the shape Apple uses as I prefer in-ear ones. Paired with a high price tag and average sound quality I looked on here to see what true wireless earbuds were available and the Tozo T10s stood out the most. They have the in-ear style earbud, compact charging case, and are very affordable. There are many different wireless earbuds to choose from but I really like the small design of the earbuds themselves, not too long, and don't come with any wing tips that take a bit longer to line up in your ear. Also the charging case is the perfect size, not being too tall or wide, and unlike the majority of other charging cases it can be charged wirelessly and is IPX8 waterproof. The sound quality of the earbuds is very good for my needs of connecting them to my Apple TV and iPad to watch TV shows, YouTube, and music. They usually last between 3-4 hours of listening out of the case which is great and when you do put them back in the case they charge back up very quickly and you can get several recharges out of the carrying case itself before it needs recharged, which also is very fast to charge up. The best method to have the earbuds pair to each other quickly and then to your device is to remove the Right one first, and very quickly (half a second after) remove the Left. That way the right starts searching and as soon as the left one comes on it picks it up and then immediately pairs to whatever device you're using. The only two things I don't like is since the right bud pairs to the left it counts as a connected device and then you can only connect to one other device (for example an iPhone.) It seems even bluetooth 5.0 still can only connect to 2 devices at the same time but since the left earbud counts as a connected device that really only leaves you one. So if they're paired to my Apple TV (which never shuts off) then if I want to connect them to my iPad they'll auto connect to the Apple TV if they were last used on it so I have to manually disconnect them and then they'll pair to the iPad. The buds both have a clickable button but it only does Play/Pause or answers a call, and if you long press it redials the last number you called. I rarely make calls on my iPhone and even if I do I'm not going to use the earbuds with it, I only use them for music and video, so I would prefer that the button functioned as media controls. One button can control several playback features (for example, I press is play/pause, 2 presses is skip forward, and 3 presses is skip back, and since both earbuds have a button one long press on the right could be volume up and one long press on the left is volume down.) Although it's not a big deal, I think those features could make these earbuds truly perfect and hopefully they can release a newer model with those features as I'd gladly buy another pair.","在过去的几年里，我一直在使用“无线”耳塞，虽然它们比有线耳塞更方便，但事实上它们仍然通过一根电线连接在一起，这仍然让它们有点“碍事”。我喜欢AirPods是真正无线的想法，并且有一个安全的存储盒来为耳塞充电，但我没有比如耳塞本身的设计，或者苹果在我喜欢的耳朵上使用的形状。再加上高昂的价格和平均的音质，我在这里看到了什么真正的无线耳塞是可用的，而Tozo T10最为突出。他们有入耳式耳塞，紧凑的充电箱，非常实惠。有很多不同的无线耳塞可供选择，但我真的很喜欢耳塞本身的小设计，不要太长，也不要附带任何需要更长时间才能排到耳朵里的翼尖。此外，充电箱是完美的尺寸，不是太高或太宽，不像大多数其他充电箱，它可以无线充电，是IPX8防水。耳塞的音质非常适合我将耳塞连接到苹果电视和iPad上观看电视节目、YouTube和音乐的需要。它们通常会持续3-4个小时的监听，这是很好的，当你把它们放回手机壳时，它们会很快充电，你可以在手机壳需要充电之前从手机壳中获得几次充电，充电也很快。让耳塞快速配对然后配对到您的设备的最佳方法是首先移除右侧耳塞，然后非常快（半秒后）移除左侧耳塞。这样，右边开始搜索，左边一出现，它就拿起它，然后立即配对到你正在使用的任何设备。我唯一不喜欢的两件事是，因为右边的耳机对到左边，它算是一个连接的设备，然后你只能连接到另一个设备（例如iPhone）。似乎即使是蓝牙5.0也只能同时连接到两个设备，但因为左边的耳机算是一个连接的设备，实际上只留给你一个。因此，如果它们与我的苹果电视配对（苹果电视从不关机），那么如果我想将它们连接到我的iPad，它们将自动连接到苹果电视（如果它们上次在iPad上使用），因此我必须手动断开它们的连接，然后它们将配对到iPad。这两个按钮都有一个可点击的按钮，但它只会播放/暂停或接听电话，如果你长按它会重拨你最后拨打的号码。我很少在iPhone上打电话，即使打了，我也不会把耳机和它一起用，我只把它们用在音乐和视频上，所以我更希望按钮能起到媒体控制的作用。一个按钮可以控制多个播放功能（例如，我按是播放/暂停，两次按是向前跳过，三次按是向后跳过，因为两个耳塞都有一个按钮，一次长按右边的按钮可以增大音量，一次长按左边的按钮可以减小音量），我认为这些功能可以使这些耳塞真正完美，并希望他们可以发布一个新的模式与这些功能，因为我很乐意购买另一双。

The case itself charges wirelessly, and the earbuds charge in the case.  This means I don't have to worry about finding a charger that fits.  No need for lightning connector, USB C, Micro USB, etc.  This charges on any wireless base there is.The sound is great too.  I admit I was worried when buying these because of the lack of wires - but the sound is better than my last pair of wired earbuds.  Definitely better than the sound from Airpods - too much noise is lost with airpods because they don't fit to the ear like earbuds do.These can get loud too, if you want that. - I never turn them up all of the way because it can get too loud for me - and I like loud music - so they get loud enough.Sound quality is great for the types of music I listen to - that includes rap, some pop, classic rock, metal like Metallica and Megadeth, harder metal like Slayer and Lamb of God.  It all sounds great.  I have Bose speakers in my car and the music with these earbuds sounds better than when I listen to the speakers in my car.Customer service is awesome too.

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,190,5,"Product works well. Easily paired and so very convenient to use. I love the ability to use the right earbud while leaving the other in the case. Allows me to have a conversation while being able to listen to music. I've owned so many earbuds but this is the best for using while my head was in a pillow which helped me recuperate while being sick. Even with all of these features, the best was the customer support and follow up from the company. It's been a long time since I've had a company that I actually felt cared about my experience. Will buy many products from them in the future.","产品运行良好。很容易配对，使用也很方便。我喜欢在把另一个放在箱子里的时候使用右耳塞的能力。允许我边听音乐边聊天。我有这么多耳塞，但这是最好的使用，而我的头是一个枕头，帮助我康复时生病。即使有所有这些功能，最好的还是来自公司的客户支持和跟进。很长一段时间以来，我一直没有一家公司让我真正感到关心我的经历。将来会从他们那里买很多产品。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,238,1,"Edit: these will not stay connected to each other.These headphones felt more expensive than they are. The volume is great. It would be better if double click skipped to the next song. They work great if you stay inside and sit still on the couch, unmoving. The minute I step outside with these, they constantly drop connection with each other and cut in and out. These headphones seem to work perfectly with my Chromebook but kinda wonky with my iphone. They are good for $30-40 headphones if you sit still in your house.","编辑：这些耳机不会保持相互连接。这些耳机感觉比现在贵。音量很大。如果双击跳过下一首歌会更好。如果你呆在家里，一动不动地坐在沙发上，它们就很管用。我一出门，他们就不停地互相拆线。这些耳机似乎与我的Chromebook完美配合，但与我的iphone有点不搭调。如果你坐在家里一动不动的话，30-40美元的耳机是不错的选择。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,164,5,"I received these yesterday and love that they came almost fully charged. I connected them right away (I was excited for new headphones, haha.)  I've listened to a few other branded headphones and they were sub par at best. These actually have a full sound. The fit of the ear buds is important, but I immediately switched to the small ear bud size knowing that's what I need. I was definitely not disappointed. These have such full sound. They have full bass and highs without being tinny. The sound is very clear and not muddy. I have daith piercings in both ears and due to these I have a hard time finding ear buds that are comfortable for long wear. These have been great. I've been wearing them all morning. I love that they cancel the noise of the room around me. I can't hear anything when music is going and everything is so much quieter if there is no music going. I love that if I leave the left ear bud in the charging case that it automatically switches the right bud to full sound instead of stereo. (I have quite a few songs that have sound for only left and right ear that pan accordingly but when only one ear bud is synced you don't lose those pieces. I work where I need to use just one ear bud sometimes and so this is an important feature for me. These have great range around the house. I can leave my phone in one room and be in a different room and still have clear sound. I've had problems with other brands and my phone being in my back pocket and cutting out but that's not an issue with these. I have only made one call so far  but the person on the other side said it was clear and easy to hear me. Its easier for me to hear the other person with these than with the iPhone speaker.I will update once I've had these a little longer.EDIT: I’ve had these for 9 months now and they still have stellar sound. They are comfortable. I don’t get complaints from the people I call. They charge quickly and hold their charge well. I still highly recommend.UPDATE 2:I am one month shy of owning these for a year and the right channel will not hold a charge. I use the left channel by itself often and it holds the charge just fine. I don't know if the right one is just defective or if my left one just got lucky on the battery life.","我昨天收到了这些，很高兴它们几乎充满了电。我马上接通了它们（我对新的耳机很兴奋，哈哈）我听过一些其他品牌的耳机，它们充其量是低于标准的。这些真的有一个完整的声音。耳塞的合适度很重要，但我知道这是我需要的，所以我马上就换了小耳塞的尺寸。我绝对没有失望。这些声音很饱满。他们的低音和高音都很饱满，但并不刺耳。声音很清楚，不浑浊。我的双耳都有戴丝穿孔，因此我很难找到适合长时间佩戴的耳塞。这些都很棒。我穿了一上午了。我喜欢他们消除了我周围房间的噪音。当音乐响起的时候，我什么都听不到，如果没有音乐响起，一切都会安静得多。我喜欢这样，如果我把左耳塞放在充电箱里，它会自动把右耳塞换成全音而不是立体声。（我有很多歌曲只有左耳和右耳的声音，但当只有一个耳朵芽同步时，你不会失去这些片段。我工作的地方有时只需要使用一个耳塞，所以这是我的一个重要特点。房子周围的范围很大。我可以把手机放在一个房间里，在另一个房间里，声音仍然清晰。我有其他品牌的问题，我的手机在我的后口袋和削减，但这不是一个问题与这些。到目前为止，我只打了一个电话，但对方说很清楚，也很容易听到我的声音。与iPhone扬声器相比，我更容易听到其他人使用这些设备。我将在使用这些设备稍长时间后进行更新。编辑：我已经使用这些设备9个月了，但它们仍然具有出色的音质。它们很舒服。我没有接到打电话的人的投诉。他们冲锋很快，控球很好。我仍然强烈推荐。更新2：我有一个月的时间来拥有这些一年，正确的渠道将不会举行收费。我经常单独使用左声道，它可以很好地保持电荷。我不知道是右边的坏掉了，还是左边的坏掉了。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,157,3,"These have amazing sound and good battery life, but the most important feature of bluetooth headphones is staying connected.  When my phone is stationary on a counter and I'm walking around a room I experience no problems whatsoever.  But when my phone is in my pocket the earbuds disconnect consistently making them unusable.  Really wish this wasn't an issue because I love everything else about these.  Sending them back :(update:  Tozo sent me a second pair of these for free saying that they had fixed the connection issue.  Unfortunately it hadn't been fixed.  I'll reiterate the fact that these sound great and are really nice quality build along w/ the charging box.  It's also possible that it could be my phone (iPhone SE) but I found that if the phone is in my pocket the earbuds won't stay connected.  My wife used them at the gym and with her phone (also an iPhone SE) in a stationary position on the treadmill that she had no connection issues.  I changed my rating to a 3 star bc of tozo's customer service, I wish I could give it a 5 star but the connection issues are still there for me.","这些耳机有惊人的声音和良好的电池寿命，但蓝牙耳机最重要的特点是保持连接。当我的手机停在柜台上，在房间里走来走去时，我一点问题也没有。但当我的手机在口袋里时，耳塞总是断开，使它们无法使用。真希望这不是个问题，因为我喜欢这一切。发回：（更新：Tozo免费给我发了第二对，说他们已经解决了连接问题。不幸的是，它没有被修复。我将重申一个事实，这些声音很好，是非常好的质量与充电箱一起建设。也有可能是我的手机（I phone SE），但我发现如果手机在我的口袋里，耳塞就不会保持连接。我的妻子在健身房使用，她的手机（还有一部iPhone SE）放在跑步机的固定位置，她没有任何连接问题。我把tozo的客户服务等级改成了3star bc，我希望我能给它一个5star，但是连接问题仍然存在。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,127,5,"Let me start by saying these are terrific!  The build quality is solid, packaging and presentation are nicely done and the sound is truly surprisingly very good with much better bass than something this small normally has.  I'm very pleased with these.  I had a pair of Phaiser's wrap around Bluetooth earbuds and they were far more finicky and not durable.  So came here looking for a replacement and wanted something that could handle sweat and found the behind the wrap annoying.  So gave this shot and wow, these blow the Phaiser earbuds away.  The charging storage case is a great touch and a useful place to store these after a work out.  The only warning I'd make is these are tiny and dark, so if you drop one of them, which I did, they're not easy to find.  The unit comes with several sized ear cups,  the standard size turned out to be a bit too big for my ears, they include two sizes smaller and one size larger.  The smallest size works best for me.  So try them for fit before going on a run,  and change if needed.  I went with the standard size out and one fell out, when I began to sweat.  Wasn't easy to find in the early morning light, but did and no harm or issue with it.  I changed the cups when I got home and now the fit is more secure.  I'd buy these again in heart beat.  Love the freedom of this style of wireless headbuds.","让我先说这些太棒了！构建质量是坚实的，包装和演示都做得很好，声音真的令人惊讶地非常好，低音比这个小的通常有更好的东西。我对这些很满意。我有一对法瑟的蓝牙耳塞，它们更挑剔，不耐用。所以来这里找一个替代品，想要一些可以处理汗水的东西，发现包装后面很烦人。所以拍了这张照片，哇哦，这把发烧友的耳塞吹走了。充电存储箱是一个伟大的触摸和一个有用的地方存储这些工作后。我唯一要警告的是这些东西又小又黑，所以如果你扔下其中一个，我确实扔下了，它们不容易找到。这个单位配备了几个大小的耳罩，标准尺寸对我的耳朵来说有点太大了，包括两个小尺寸和一个大尺寸。最小的尺寸最适合我。所以在跑步前试着穿上，如果需要的话可以换上。当我开始出汗时，我把标准尺寸的衣服脱了出来，有一件掉了下来。在清晨的阳光下不容易找到，但却没有造成任何伤害或问题。回家后我换了杯子，现在合身更安全了。我会在心跳时再买一次。喜欢这种无线耳机的自由。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,118,5,"Here's my quick opinion: I'm a 45 year old guy, no audiophile and I wanted something cheap to use with my tablet so I could watch shows while in waiting rooms and sitting around.  These are perfect and I love them.Here's more detail:From the description page these Tozo T10 look a little cheap as well as the case. They are not at all. They seem very durable, the case is heavier than it looks and has 3 very strong little magnets that hold the lid shut. I thought the lid would be thin cheap plastic, but it's actually quite thick and seems sturdy. I take the whole case out of my work lunch box and toss it on the bed so I can charge it later and it stays shut. I even tried grabbing the case by the sides, and shook it, trying to get it to open and get the earbuds to fly out. They wont. Impressive.Wireless charging works great.The sound quality is great from these. Like I said, I watch movies on a kindle and using only 1 earbud, I have the  volume at about 75%. If I were to use both, I would be good at about 50%. I won't say these are extra loud, but should be plenty loud enough for most people.So after having these for a couple of days and using them, I am very, very happy for what I got for the price. As long as they last a while, they'll be perfect. I would definitely buy again.","我的观点很简单：我是一个45岁的人，不爱听音乐，我想用我的平板电脑买些便宜的东西，这样我就可以在候诊室和坐着看节目了。这些都是完美的，我喜欢。这里有更多的细节：从描述页这些Tozo T10看起来有点便宜，以及案件。他们一点也不。它们看起来非常耐用，箱子比看上去更重，有3个非常坚固的小磁铁，可以把盖子关上。我原以为盖子是薄而便宜的塑料，但实际上很厚，而且看起来很结实。我把整个箱子从我的工作午餐盒里拿出来，扔在床上，这样我可以在以后充电，它就不动了。我甚至试着抓住箱子的两边，摇晃它，试着打开它，让耳塞飞出来。他们不会的。令人印象深刻。无线充电工作很好。声音质量很好。就像我说的，我在kindle上看电影，只用一个耳塞，我的音量大约是75%。如果我同时使用这两种方法，我将擅长50%左右。我不会说这些声音特别大，但对大多数人来说应该足够大。所以在用了几天之后，我非常非常高兴能以这样的价格买到这些。只要他们坚持一段时间，他们就会完美。我一定会再买一次。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,103,5,I bought these ear buds mostly to use while at work so I wanted them to be wireless and a bit discrete too. These earbuds are great for me. I was worried about buying earbuds off amazon cause of all the scammers out there but these have impressed me quite a bit. They are pretty small with a decent connection range and great sound quality. I was wondering how well they would stay in cause I would be moving around a lot and I also have pretty small ears but they stay great they come with different size buds which was great. And it also has a somewhat portable charger. It has a case that can hold about a four hour charge so u can charge ur buds while on the go if they die out on yay. Overall a great purchase for me I’ve recommended them to a few of my coworkers.,"我买的这些耳塞主要是在工作时使用的，所以我希望它们是无线的，也有点不连续。这些耳塞对我很好。我很担心从亚马逊购买耳塞，因为那里有很多骗子，但这些给我留下了很深的印象。它们很小，连接范围很好，音质也很好。我想知道他们会呆在那里有多好，因为我会经常走动，我也有很小的耳朵，但是他们很好，他们有不同大小的花蕾，这很好。它还有一个便携式充电器。它有一个能装四个小时电的箱子，这样你就可以在外出时给你的花蕾充电，如果它们死于yay。总的来说，这对我来说是一笔大买卖，我向我的一些同事推荐过。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,109,1,"The device itself, as headphones works great. The build quality is nice with a soft rubber finish. Being able to wireless-charge the buds with the case is a convenient feature. These fit me well and remain in place. These are also good at isolating you from outside noise.A major annoyance: I don't think you can use these in mono mode. The right bud will beep every 10 seconds or so if used alone. I think if you pull out the left bud, let it connect and replace it back in the case, the right bud will beep for 20 seconds (once per 10s interval) and then it seems to stop. An annoyance, but still a 5-star product at this point.The reason for the 1 star review:  the microphone is completely useless. It's not even sub-par or low quality. I call my work line using my cell and even with the right bud 2 inches from my mouth, my own voice felt like very low background noise -from far, far away.I really wanted to like these... but I'll have to return them.","设备本身，作为耳机工作得很好。建筑质量很好与软橡胶完成。能够无线充电的芽与案件是一个方便的功能。这些东西很适合我，而且还保持原样。它们也能很好地将你与外界的噪音隔离开来。一个主要的烦恼是：我认为你不能在单声道模式下使用它们。如果单独使用，正确的花蕾会每10秒左右发出一次哔哔声。我想如果你拔出左芽，让它连接起来，然后把它放回箱子里，右芽会发出20秒的哔哔声（每10秒一次），然后它似乎停止了。一个烦恼，但在这一点上仍然是一个五星级产品。原因是一星级评论：麦克风是完全无用的。它甚至没有低于标准或低质量。我用手机打电话给我的工作线，即使是离我嘴2英寸远的右花蕾，我自己的声音感觉就像很低的背景噪音-从很远很远很远的地方。我真的很想喜欢这些。。。但我得把它们还回去。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,86,5,"This was the first product that I really wanted to go out of the way to review the moment I turned them on. However, I wanted to give them some time to make sure that I would still be satisfied with them a few weeks down the line and all I can say is that I have never been more happier with a purchase. I really enjoy these.The moment I tried them, I was immediately impressed with the sound quality as it was multiple times better than the wired earphones that came with my Samsung Galaxy s9. With my previous earphones, I would still manage to have a hard time hearing the majority of audio even at maximum volume.However, now using these, I rarely even find myself putting the volume above the standard warning you receive when placing the volume too high. Even with my volume halfway, I can hear the audio in the same way as if it were at full volume. On top of that, the quality of the bass was immediately noticable and made everything so much more better to listen to.As well, many times before, I have found myself trying to find ways to where I could listen to music simultaneously while taking a shower or accomplishing other activities that tend to obstruct the clarity of music. With these, I don't have to worry about the possibility of my neighbors complaining about my music being too loud anymore. The fact that these are bluetooth and waterproof have really been useful to help cut out the middle man and take the music wherever I wish to listen to it. All without the cord in standard wired earphones getting caught up in things and getting tangled up by the time I pull them out of my pocket.It comes with extra sillicone ear buds, a charging usb cable, and that fabric cord (I dont know what it's called) that is used for the wireless charging container to be hung with. The charging container itself is magnetic which makes the lid durable, and it makes its grip on the bluetooth earbuds firm enough not to fall out when placed inside to charger.Some tips:1. I'm not sure if it comes with a brick to charge but I use a standard phone charger with the usb cable it comes with2. When taking them out to pair with phones, I sometimes have to take them out once, and instead place it back in to see the red lights, and take them out once more ready to be paired.3. I use multiple devices to transition between, such as my phone and my laptop. So if I'm using my laptop on the bus along with these earbuds and need to put my laptop away when I am getting off, I shut off my laptops bluetooth first before putting it away, and then turn on my phone's bluetooth to connect it with the Tozo Earbuds.And I do this process vice versa.I really couldn't be more excited to recommend these enough times. Great product!","这是我第一个真正想在开机的那一刻特意复习的产品。不过，我想给他们一些时间，以确保在接下来的几周里，我仍然对他们感到满意，我只能说，我从来没有像现在这样对他们更满意。我真的很喜欢这些，当我试着用的时候，我立刻对它的音质印象深刻，因为它比我的三星Galaxy s9附带的有线耳机好多倍。使用我以前的耳机，即使在最大音量的情况下，我仍然很难听到大部分的声音。但是，现在使用这些耳机，我甚至很少发现自己在音量过高时会将音量超过你收到的标准警告。即使把音量调到一半，我也能像听到满音量一样听到声音。除此之外，贝司的音质很快就被人注意到了，让所有的东西听起来都好得多。而且，以前很多次，我发现自己试图找到一种方法，在洗澡或完成其他可能妨碍音乐清晰度的活动时，可以同时听音乐。有了这些，我就不用担心邻居会抱怨我的音乐太吵了。事实上，这些是蓝牙和防水的，真的有助于切断中间人，把音乐带到任何我想听的地方。当我从口袋里掏出标准的有线耳机时，所有的耳机线都会被东西缠住和缠住。它还配有额外的硅橡胶耳塞、充电usb线和用来悬挂无线充电容器的织物线（我不知道叫什么）。充电容器本身是磁性的，这使盖子耐用，它使其抓握蓝牙耳塞足够牢固，放在充电器里时不会掉出来。我不确定它是否带有一块砖头来充电，但我使用一个标准的带有usb线的手机充电器。当我带他们出去和手机配对时，我有时要把他们拿出来一次，然后放回去看红灯，然后再拿出来准备配对。我使用多个设备在两者之间切换，例如我的手机和笔记本电脑。所以，如果我在公交车上使用笔记本电脑和这些耳塞，下车时需要把笔记本电脑收起来，我会先关掉笔记本电脑的蓝牙，然后再收起来，然后打开手机的蓝牙，把它和Tozo耳机连接起来。我做这个过程，反之亦然。我真的很兴奋推荐这些足够的时间。很棒的产品！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,79,5,"I've only had these for a couple days, but I put my stuff through the wringer. I carry the mail in Ohio and I use these to listen to J. Vernon McGee's Thru the Bible while I walk. I have already had them out in the pouring rain and they worked perfectly. I'm no audiophile, but I hate tinny sounding cheap headphones. I'm extremely picky, and that's why I sent back a set of the mpow BT earbuds, and another that I can't remember the name of. Both sounded very cheap. These have deep bass, and are very loud. I deliver mail on a busy 4 lane and have absolutely no problem hearing the sermons.I am always moving and have never had one work its way loose. No need for adjustments at all. I put one in, and it stays where I put it. THE BATTERY IS BETTER THAN ADVERTISED. I only use one earbud at a time for safety reasons, so I use one until it starts telling me the batter is almost dead, and then I switch out. When you switch to the other one, you have to open the blue tooth menu on your phone and have it forget the one you are disconnecting and then repair the other one. Takes about 10 seconds literally. I'm just happy that you can use either one independently of the other one. The last pair I tried advertised that you could, but the right bud was the only one that actually connected to the phone. These TORO's are awesome. Work better than I expected to, and I will definitely shop with them again.GREAT PRODUCT TORO. I don't leave a lot of reviews, but when someone puts out a better product than the competition, and then sells if for about 60% of the crappier one, I like to say thanks.","我只吃了几天，但我把东西都塞进了绞衣架。我在俄亥俄州带着邮件，走路时用这些来听弗农・麦基的《圣经通读》。我已经让他们在倾盆大雨中出来了，他们干得很好。我不喜欢听音乐，但我讨厌听上去很便宜的耳机。我非常挑剔，所以我寄回了一套mpow BT耳塞，还有一个我记不清名字了。听起来都很便宜。这些有很深的低音，而且很响。我在一条繁忙的四车道上投递邮件，听布道完全没有问题。我总是在移动，从来没有一个工作是如此轻松。根本不需要调整。我放了一个，它就留在我放的地方。电池比广告上的好。出于安全考虑，我一次只使用一个耳塞，所以我使用一个耳塞，直到它开始告诉我击球手快死了，然后我就关机。当你切换到另一个时，你必须打开手机上的蓝牙菜单，让它忘记你正在断开的那个，然后修理另一个。大约需要10秒。我很高兴你能独立使用其中一个。我试过的最后一对广告上说你可以，但真正连接到电话上的只有右花蕾。这些TORO真是太棒了。工作比我预期的要好，我一定会再次和他们一起购物。很棒的产品。我不会留下太多评论，但当有人拿出比竞争对手更好的产品，然后以大约60%的差劲价格卖出时，我想说声谢谢。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,78,5,"I purchased these headphones on a flash sale, so I got them at a reduced price. I figured, even if I don't like them, they weren't that much. I haven’t had them very long, but I’ve been surprisingly pleased with them.So far, I’ve used them mainly at my office to watch Netflix during my lunch break. I have on a couple occasions used them for a few hours without any problems with the batteries running out. I really like that the carrying case holds a reserve charge to recharge the headphones when put back in.I have never been able to comfortably wear a pair of Apple headphones, so I always avoid those kinds of earbuds. So far, they have been comfortable to wear. I haven’t had a chance to wear them to workout yet. So, I can’t speak to how well they stay in once I get moving. However, given the snugness of the fit with the current buds I have on them (the original pair that came attached), they feel pretty secure. I don’t foresee them coming out.One of the things that initially drew my attention to these headphones was the IPX8 rating. While I do swim quite a bit, I don’t think I will be attempting to swim with them though. Bluetooth doesn’t work well in water. However, I do have to work outside sometimes in the rain. So, it will be nice that I don’t have to quickly put them away.For the most part, I’m happy with the sound quality. I prefer more of a flat response, so I find them to be a little bass heavy. But that also means I was surprised at how much bass they actually put out. (Free tip: if you are using Spotify on your iPhone, there is an EQ feature so you can adjust the lower end if it’s too much.) Again, I’ve used them mostly for Netflix, so I haven’t noticed it as much. I was very surprised at how loud they can get.The sound quality of the mic is about what you’d expect from a pair of headphones. They work well enough to communicate. Just don’t expect to record vocals for your next platinum selling album with them.The Bluetooth is very quick to connect to my computer. They are usually connected by the time I can even get them in my ears. Even with the Bluetooth 5.0, there is some latency though. But, that is to be expected. It would be nice if they had aptX to help with that. However, given the low price, how new aptX is, being Bluetooth 5.0, and having an IPX8 rating, I can hardly expect that.I really like the case. It is somewhat bulky, but that’s the tradeoff to have a case that provides a reserve charge for your earbuds. I also liked that the cover is slightly transparent so I can see the battery level without having to open it. I also love that the case is equipped with Qi charging capabilities. I would say that the charging cable, measuring in at just over 12 inches, is really short. But, again, at this price, I can hardly fault them for not making it any longer. And, it’s not like you’re going to need them plugged in while you’re using them.Bottom line, I don’t think you’re going to find a better pair of earbuds with as many features at a better price.*** REVIEW UPDATE***I've now had these headphones for almost a year. I'm still pretty pleased with these headphones. Again, they're not an audiophile's dream headphone by any stretch of the imagination. But, they are ok sound quality. They produce good volume and they are comfortable to wear. For the most part, they stay in my ears pretty well. I need to readjust them sometimes but no more often than I would need to with any other headphones. I have not had the issue I have had with many other earbuds in the past of the tips coming off. I think this is mainly because I keep them in the case if I'm not wearing them.Occasionally, if they don't click into the case just right, they won't charge. However, the case also has a small red light to indicate that it's in the case and charging. So, I know right away if I need to reinsert or adjust the earbud. Also, occasionally, they don't connect properly to the device. However, all I need to do is pop them back in their case for a second. When I take them back out, they usually automatically connect to my device without any issues.I'm still quite pleased with the battery life of the earbuds themselves and the extra charge of the case. And being able to wirelessly charge the case is an awesome feature.What I haven't been as happy with is the audio quality of the mic. I've tried using it on a couple of occasions, but the person on the other end has had a hard time hearing me. So, I've given up using it for that. But, that's not my reason for choosing them, so it's not much of a concern for me.Overall, time-tested, I still give these headphones a good review.","这些耳机是我在特价时买的，所以我降价买的。我想，即使我不喜欢它们，它们也没那么多。我没吃多久，但我对它们感到意外的满意。到目前为止，我主要在办公室用它们在午休时间看Netflix。我有几次用了几个小时，电池没问题了。我真的很喜欢手机套里装着一个备用充电的耳机，我从来没能舒服地戴上一副苹果耳机，所以我总是避免戴那种耳塞。到目前为止，它们穿起来很舒服。我还没有机会穿它们去锻炼。所以，我不能说我一搬家他们就住得多好。然而，考虑到我现在戴在上面的花蕾（最初的那一对）和合身的感觉，它们感觉很安全。我没有预见到它们会出现，最初吸引我注意这些耳机的一个因素是IPX8的等级。虽然我经常游泳，但我想我不会和他们一起游泳。蓝牙在水中不太好用。然而，我确实不得不在外面工作有时在雨中。所以，不用很快把它们收起来就好了。在很大程度上，我对音质很满意。我更喜欢平淡的反应，所以我觉得它们有点重低音。但这也意味着我很惊讶他们到底演奏了多少低音。（免费提示：如果你在iPhone上使用Spotify，有一个EQ功能，如果太多的话，你可以调整低端。）同样，我主要是在Netflix上使用它们，所以我没有注意到太多。我很惊讶它们能发出这么大的声音。麦克风的音质和你对耳机的期望差不多。他们工作得很好，可以交流。只是别指望用它为你的下一张白金专辑录制人声。蓝牙可以很快连接到我的电脑。它们通常在我能听到它们的时候就已经连接起来了。即使使用蓝牙5.0，也有一些延迟。但是，这是意料之中的。如果他们有aptX来帮忙就好了。然而，考虑到价格低廉，新的aptX是如何，蓝牙5.0，并有IPX8的评级，我几乎无法预料，我真的很喜欢这个情况。这是有点笨重，但这是一个权衡，有一个案件，提供了一个备用费，你的耳塞。我也喜欢盖子是稍微透明的，这样我就可以看到电池电量而不必打开它。我也很喜欢这个箱子配备了充气功能。我想说的是，充电电缆，测量在刚刚超过12英寸，是真的很短。但是，再说一次，以这个价格，我不能责怪他们不再生产了。而且，这并不是说你在使用耳机时需要插上电源。总之，我不认为你会找到一副更好的耳塞，它有更多的功能，价格也更便宜。***回顾一下最新情况**我已经用了将近一年了。我对这些耳机还是很满意的。再说一次，他们不是一个爱听音乐的人的梦想耳机的任何延伸的想象力。但是，它们的音质还可以。它们体积大，穿着舒适。在很大程度上，它们在我的耳朵里很好。有时我需要重新调整它们，但不会比其他耳机更频繁。我没有问题，我已经与许多其他耳塞在过去的小费来了。我想这主要是因为如果我不穿的话，我会把它们放在箱子里。有时候，如果它们没有按对，就不会收费。不过，这个箱子也有一个小红灯，表示它在箱子里，正在充电。所以，我知道我是否需要重新插入或调整耳塞。此外，有时，它们无法正确连接到设备。不过，我要做的就是把它们放回箱子里一秒钟。当我把它们拿出来的时候，它们通常会自动连接到我的设备上而不会有任何问题。我仍然对耳塞本身的电池寿命和外壳的额外充电感到非常满意。而且能够无线充电是一个很棒的功能，但我不太满意的是麦克风的音质。我试过几次用它，但另一端的人听不见我说话。所以，我已经放弃了使用它。但是，这不是我选择耳机的原因，所以这对我来说并不是什么大问题。总的来说，经过时间的考验，我还是对这些耳机进行了很好的评价。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,77,5,"First thing I noticed was the look and feel of these earbuds give off a quality built product.The earbuds automatically turn on when removed from the case. After inserting them into my ear and rotating them into place, they felt very secure. Both earbuds proceed to tell you that they connect to each other as a pair and once syncd via Bluetooth to your phone, will say Device Connected. When you put the earbuds back in the case they automatically disconnect from your device and turn off to be charged.As far as sound, there is a great balance between bass and all around sound quality. If I had to rate the sound quality, I would say it’s between a skull candy bass earbuds and Dre Beats ear bud.The case itself being a charger is awesome and it has plenty of indicator lights showing you that it’s charging and how much battery life is in the case before it needs to be recharged.The Vendor was also very proactive in making sure everything was working properly and that there were no issues.Overall I’m very impressed with these earbuds at such a great price. Definitely worth the money.","我注意到的第一件事是这些耳塞的外观和感觉发出了一个高质量的产品。当耳塞从盒子里取出时，它会自动打开。将它们插入我的耳朵并旋转到位后，它们感到非常安全。两个耳塞都会告诉你它们是成对连接的，一旦通过蓝牙同步到你的手机上，就会说设备已连接。当你把耳塞放回手机壳时，耳塞会自动与你的设备断开，然后关机充电。就声音而言，低音和周围的音质之间有很大的平衡。如果我要给音质打分的话，我会说它介于骷髅糖低音耳塞和Dre Beats耳塞之间。这个手机壳本身就是一个充电器，它有很多指示灯，告诉你它正在充电，在需要充电前手机壳的电池寿命有多长。厂商也非常主动地确保一切正常，没有问题。总的来说，我对这些耳塞印象深刻，价格非常高。绝对值这个钱。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: WHITE,48,1,"Bought these earbuds 2 weeks ago as my first experience with Bluetooth earbuds.Design is nice and it comes with a bunch of different tips so they can really fit into your ear, a plus for that.BUT, once I started listening to videos on my tablet, I noticed that the sound had a micro-second difference with the actual video. Thought it wasn't that bad.BUT, I tried with my app Duolingo and  not only it lagged but everytime they were saying something, I would miss the first or second word because of the bad connection.With just that, I was happy I didn't spend more money into that kinda product.BUT after just 2 weeks, the earbuds wouldn't connect anymore with my phone. Don't know why, but it would take 5 attempt to finally connect.On top of all that, reviews on this product are potentially fake. Once you register your product online for the warranty, you get an email asking you to rate 5 stars and in exchange, they send you a wireless charger.  So beware that from that 10 000 plus reviews, a lot of them were bought from the company itself.I returned them and bought another brand for cheaper....better sound, better connection.","两周前买了这些耳塞，作为我第一次使用蓝牙耳塞的体验。设计很好，而且有很多不同的窍门，这样耳塞才能真正适合你的耳朵，这是一个优势。但是，当我开始在平板电脑上听视频时，我注意到声音与实际的视频有微秒的差异。我觉得没那么糟。但是，我试着用我的应用程序Duolingo，不仅它落后了，而且每次他们说什么，我都会因为连接不好而错过第一个或第二个词。就这样，我很高兴我没有在这种产品上花更多的钱。但是仅仅两周后，耳塞就不再和我的手机连接了。不知道为什么，但最终连接需要5次尝试。最重要的是，对这个产品的评论可能是假的。一旦你在网上注册了产品的保修期，你就会收到一封电子邮件，要求你对5星级产品进行评级，作为交换，他们会给你发送一个无线充电器。所以要注意的是，从那10000多条评论中，有很多是从公司本身买来的，我把它们退了回来，买了另一个品牌，价格更便宜……更好的声音，更好的连接。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,53,2,"The sound quality is great. They stay in ear well when working out. The biggest down fall is that the left and right bud do not stay streaming at the same time. Audio on the left channel drops in and out when music is playing for the slightest reason.

For that reason alone I give it a 2 star because that is over all terrible quality for headphones.―-update―-The company reached out to me after I posted my original review offering to send me a new pair in exchange for a better review. I assured them that had I received a working pair I would change my review. They would only offer me a replacement pair if I changed my review first. Unethical returning to sender and purchasing from a different vendor.","音质很好。他们在锻炼时能很好地保持听力。最大的落差是左右花蕾不同时流淌。当播放音乐时，左声道上的音频会因一点小的原因进出。头部移动，手机移动，静止不动。。。如果你想进入一个最佳状态去拥有一个耳塞，却无缘无故地停止工作，那就太烦人了。仅此一个原因，我就给了它一个2星级，因为耳机的质量太差了。―更新――在我发布了最初的评论后，公司联系我，提出给我寄一双新的，以换取更好的评论。我向他们保证，如果我收到一双工作鞋，我会改变我的评价。如果我先修改我的评论，他们只会给我一对替代品。退回寄件人并从其他供应商处购买是不道德的。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,53,3,"I really wanted to love these. The sound quality is excellent, they are super comfortable, and I loved the idea of being able to wirelessly charge them. However, they just don't hold up to use. The left earbud CONTINUOUSLY cuts in and out, especially when I am moving, which basically defeats the entire purpose of using them. It's so distracting. I've unpaired and repaired them several times, and even restarted my phone, all to no avail, I've only worn them three times and the problem just keeps getting worse. I was so happy with them at first that I threw away all the packaging and can't even return them. Very disappointing, especially for the price. :( Maybe you'll have better luck.[update 2/12/19] The seller reached out to me and offered to send me a new pair, which was wonderful, and I added one more star for their customer service (although they did send me way too many emails bugging me about updating my review).

All in all, these do not work for me.","我真的很想喜欢这些。音质非常好，非常舒适，我喜欢能够无线充电的想法。然而，他们只是不能坚持使用。左耳塞不断地进出，特别是当我移动时，这基本上破坏了使用它们的全部目的。太让人分心了。我已经好几次不穿衣服修理了，甚至重新启动了手机，都没有用，我只穿了三次，问题越来越严重。一开始我对他们很满意，把所有的包装都扔掉了，甚至还不能退货。非常令人失望，尤其是价格方面。：（也许你会有更好的运气。[更新2/12/19]卖家主动联系我，提出给我寄一双新的，这太棒了，我又为他们的客户服务加了一颗星（尽管他们确实给我发了太多关于更新我的评论的邮件）。不幸的是，他们送来的新耳塞比第一个更糟糕，我一放进耳朵，两个耳塞几乎就被剪了。总之，这些对我不起作用。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,46,1,"I bought a pair of these earlier this year and gave a 1 star review. This was mainly because the left earbud would constantly disconnect. The manufacturer told me I just got a defective pair, and that they would send a new pair if I was willing to delete my review. This seemed fair enough, and they quickly sent out a new pair once the review was deleted.Unfortunately, the new pair has the same issues as before, and I would recommend not buying these. The sound quality isn’t bad, but the non stop cutting out of the left earbud is a dealbreaker when it comes to wireless earbuds. I appreciate that they were willing to make this right, but 2 pairs of bad earbuds don’t help anyone. I highly recommend spending more on a better brand.","今年早些时候，我买了一双这样的鞋，并给了我一星级的评价。这主要是因为左耳塞会不断断开。制造商告诉我，我刚买了一双有缺陷的，如果我愿意删除我的评论，他们会寄一双新的。这似乎很公平，他们很快就发出了一个新的对一次审查被删除。不幸的是，新的对有同样的问题，我建议不要购买这些。音质还不错，但在无线耳机方面，不停地剪下左耳塞是一个突破。我很感激他们愿意纠正这一点，但两副坏耳塞对任何人都没有帮助。我强烈建议花更多的钱买一个更好的品牌。

Then the right one came back to life and would only work when I took breaths and wasn’t in the water. I put the left ear bud on the deck and continued swimming with the right.

The sound quality for music and movies from my iPad are pretty decent.I paired it with a total of 4 devices and have been using it for a about 6 months with a mixed experience.If there is only 1 device in the vicinity, then it takes an abnormally long time to pair with it, and it is constantly scanning for the other devices making a ping sound when unable to pair  (WHY??), causing a huge nuisance. So now, I have reset them both multiple times and have it paired with just one device. And still it keeps seeking the other missing device(s?). What a very strange ghostly behavior. And yes, resetting it multiple times seems to have minimal effect on this behavior.  So, I have wasted $50. It's not worth considering these as a alternative to any of name brands!!","在阅读了所有的好评和期望之后，我购买了这个产品。我对这个产品的体验是一个混合袋。当从充电箱中取出第一个设备和左侧通道时，它很容易配对。我用iPad制作的音乐和电影的音质相当不错，我一共用了4台设备，用了6个月左右，体验不一，如果附近只有1台设备，那就要花很长的时间来搭配，当无法配对时，它会不断扫描其他设备发出ping声（为什么？？）造成了巨大的麻烦。所以现在，我已经多次重置它们，并且只将它们与一个设备配对。它仍然在寻找另一个丢失的设备。多么奇怪的鬼魂行为。是的，多次重置它似乎对这种行为的影响很小。所以，我浪费了50美元。不值得把这些当作任何名牌的替代品！！

They asked me to reset the earbuds and I've done so and issue was still the same. I asked them what the next step is and they've gone silent until now. That being said, I decided to just return afterwards.Bottom Line is 3 Stars overall rating.1 Star on Material quality.5 Star on Sound quality.5 Star on Battery life.What turned me off was the connection of the left earbud.In case if anyone is wondering what functions this one have. Both right and left earbud have buttons that clicks and have same function. Power on/off, answer call, reject call, hang up, stop and play music. There is no rewind, fast forward, skip track, volume control.

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,20,4,"These are of an okay quality. The sound quality is just good, albeit a little grainy with heavy music. Batty life is also very short, only around 3-4 hours of active listening. This may seem sufficient but for a commuter, it's a nuisance having to recharge so frequently. They also don't fit comfortably in the ear, and are prone to slipping out (not suitable to the  gym). I've tried multiple sizes for the rubber and the earphones still fall out, sometimes in the middle of the street. The left earbud also chips out at random times, even when I'm being sedentary.

If you want average sound quality and don't care about connectivity or battery life, these may be right for you. I will be returning as I don't believe they are worth the price.Update 3/21: The company reached out to me and offered a replacement that's a different model from the one shown here. I am increasing my review from 3  to 4 stars, in compliment of the customer service received.","这些质量不错。音质很好，虽然有点颗粒重音乐。巴蒂的寿命也很短，只有3-4个小时的积极聆听。这似乎已经足够了，但对于通勤者来说，如此频繁的充电是一件麻烦的事。它们在耳朵里也不舒服，容易滑倒（不适合去健身房）。我试过多种尺寸的橡胶耳机，但耳机还是会掉出来，有时会掉到街中央。即使在我久坐的时候，左耳塞也会随机脱落。也就是说，这些耳机并不可怕。体积小，便于携带。如果你想要平均的音质，而不关心连接或电池寿命，这些可能适合你。我将返回，因为我不相信他们值得的价格。更新3/21：该公司联系我，并提供了一个替代品，这是一个不同的模式，从这里显示。我将我的评论从3星增加到4星，以表扬收到的客户服务。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,19,1,"Extremely disappointed. They paired nicely, had a good fit and sounded great for almost 10 seconds! Then the left ear bus kept going out every few seconds. I tried disconnecting and reconnecting several times and there was no change. Even tried with another device and same disapointment. Sadly I will have to return them. I was really hoping for some nice wireless ear buds.","非常失望。它们搭配得很好，很合身，几乎10秒钟的声音都很棒！然后，左耳巴士每隔几秒钟就开走一次。我试过几次断开和重新连接，结果没有变化。甚至尝试了另一个设备和相同的偏离。很遗憾，我得把它们还回去。我真的很希望有个好的无线耳塞。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,19,1,So this product lasts until just past the return window. Convenient. They worked perfectly fine for a month. Then over the last week have not held a charge and there is zero way to contact about this. The support is only for setting up. But they simple pretty peices of plastic and wires now. No matter how long I charge them plugged in or on the base. They work for 10 mins and then blink low and turn off almost instantly. Would be nice if I could get a replacement or just a refund so I can try a different brand. This. Sucks.,"所以这个产品一直持续到刚过退货窗口。方便。他们工作了整整一个月。然后在过去的一周里没有任何指控，也没有任何联系方式。支持只用于设置。但是现在他们用塑料和电线做的很简单。不管我给他们充电多长时间，插上电源还是在底座上。它们工作10分钟，然后低眨眼，几乎立即关闭。如果我能换一个，或者只是退款，这样我就可以尝试不同的品牌，那就太好了。这个。烂透了。

I really wanted to try the true wireless headphones without paying 160 for them, but I don't have experience with other headphones like this...","好吧，我不太喜欢这种连接，因为它只有10米长（我甚至不会这么说……）。它们是很好的耳机，我只是没有办法在没有手机的情况下手动改变音量和/或歌曲。但我也可能被Ifrogz无线耳机宠坏了。我真的很想尝试真正的无线耳机，不用花160美元，但我没有经验与其他耳机这样。。。

I thought I would try a different brand, and when I put these in my ear, they fell out within seconds. I was about to give up, pack up the box, and send it back, but I decided to check out the instruction manual in case i was doing something wrong. I’m so happy I did. Turns out there were 4 sizes of plastic ear caps included with the earbuds. On my third try, the second smallest ones, I felt how i imagine Cinderella felt when she tried on the glass slipper. They were perfect and no matter how much I jumped up and down or shook my head, they stayed in place!The quality of sound is impeccable, nice highs and lows, with a decent amount of bass. Once I found the right match, the fit was extremely comfortable.I love these headphones, they have already changed my life for the better!","我是极少数不能使用苹果气荚的人之一。不管我怎么努力，它们不到一分钟就从我耳朵里掉了出来。我想我可以换个牌子，当我把它们放进耳朵里时，几秒钟就掉了。我正要放弃，收拾好盒子，寄回去，但我决定看看说明书，以防我做错了什么。我很高兴我做到了。结果发现，有4个大小的塑料耳罩包括在耳塞。在我的第三次尝试，第二次最小的尝试中，我感觉到灰姑娘试穿玻璃拖鞋时的感觉。他们是完美的，无论我跳上跳下或摇头，他们留在原地！音质无可挑剔，高音和低音都不错，低音也不错。一旦找到了合适的搭配，合身的感觉非常舒服。我喜欢这些耳机，它们已经改变了我的生活！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,0,5,"I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.","我对Tozo T10印象深刻。包装令人难以置信，建造质量是一流的，一套惊人的功能，即使价格是两倍高的价格。无线充电、IPX8防水、高质量的8mm声音驱动程序和蓝牙v5.0只是T10必须提供的高端功能中的一部分，将它们与我的手机配对太容易了。你只需要把它们从充电箱里拿出来，就可以配对了（只需简单地说一句，确保你选择ZO-T10-R，右耳塞是主要的）。蓝牙v5.0意味着他们有更强的连接和更长的距离。我可以把它们放在我的背包里，我仍然可以连接到30英尺远的地方。高音的清晰度和低音的丰满度都是最高端耳塞的品质水平。我个人把这些带进了淋浴间，我当时并没有洗澡，耳塞和手机壳本身都是非常防水的。我惊喜地发现，我可以用我的T10手机充电四个多小时，而且充电箱可以为耳塞充电四次。最后，我要说的是，齐无线充电箱非常方便。我可以把手机和耳塞套放在我的充电板上，我可以走了。如果你从未使用过无线充电，你需要。总之，我在市场上找不到比这更好的耳塞了。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,0,5,"Every Christmas I usually have enough personal money to make an impulse purchase, usually in Electronics. This year, I wanted to upgrade the $20 pair of totally wireless sound (TWS) earbuds I had. They were good, but needed better sound to make them perfect.With a budget of about $100, I started off looking for something good from a known manufacturer (like Samsung, Jabra, etc.) There was just nothing out there in my price range. I couldn't see myself paying that kind of money from a brand I didn't know, so I started looking for a cheaper model. For around $50 I found 3-4 that looked good and reviews were good enough. I liked Anker's other Bluetooth earphones, so the Soundcore Liberty Lites were considered. With the good reviews and previous good ownership of Monoprice products the Monoprice IPX4s were looking good, too.Due diligence and a desire to be able to use one earbud at a time drive me to search Amazon's best rated under $50 TWS sets, and Tozo looked pretty good. While the buds are labeled L and R, they are both the same, and can be put into either ear. They come with 4 tips, and for the first time, I'm not using the largest ones. So if you have really big ear canals and find it hard to get tips that fit, you may find a good fit here.The sound won't knock Bose out of the water, but for the forty dollars I paid, it is good, and an outstanding upgrade from my $20 pair. It has nice bass, and well defined mids and highs.Battery time is right around 4 hours at low volume (I wear them at work as background noise). The travel case can charge one while the other is playing, so I don't find it hard to get through a work day with them. I like the charging case, too. It's well built, and can use a Qi wireless charger, which I don't care about really. There are 4 lights to tell you how charged it is. it closes and fits in a pocket. I can't tell you how many charges it will take, because I usually keep it plugged in.Pairing, once initially done, is easy. Just pull a bud off the charger and it will turn on and start looking for your paired device. Since I'm using one at a time, I find I need to turn the one I'm using off completely first, then get the other one. I paired them first together, and then separate. This is the best part of these for me, almost seamless use.All in all, very happy with the purchase. And I save up some money to get something else. I have already recommended these to people (my brother is not convinced, he has bone conducting headphones he likes). I do like them that much.","每年圣诞节，我通常都有足够的个人资金来进行冲动购买，通常是在电子产品领域。今年，我想升级20美元的全无线耳机。它们很好，但需要更好的声音才能使它们完美。预算约为100美元，我开始从一家知名制造商（如三星、雅布拉等）那里寻找一些好东西，但在我的价格范围内什么都没有。我看不到自己从一个我不知道的品牌那里花了那么多钱，所以我开始寻找一个更便宜的型号。50美元左右，我发现3-4看起来不错，评论也不错。我喜欢Anker的其他蓝牙耳机，所以考虑了Soundcore Liberty Lite。由于对Monoprice产品的良好评价和之前的良好所有权，Monoprice IPX4看起来也不错。尽职调查和一次只能使用一个耳塞的愿望驱使我搜索亚马逊最好的50美元以下的TWS套件，而Tozo看起来相当不错。当花蕾被标记为L和R时，它们都是一样的，并且可以放在两个耳朵里。它们有4个提示，我第一次不用最大的。所以如果你的耳道真的很大，很难找到合适的建议，你可能会在这里找到一个合适的。声音不会把Bose从水中打掉，但是我花了40美元，就很好了，而且比我20美元的一双升级得更好。它有很好的低音，清晰的中高音。在低音量下，电池时间大约为4小时（我在工作时戴着它们作为背景噪音）。旅行箱可以一边玩一边收费，所以我觉得和他们一起度过一个工作日并不难。我也喜欢充电箱。它的结构很好，可以使用一个Qi无线充电器，我真的不在乎。有4盏灯可以告诉你它的充电情况。它合上放在口袋里。我不能告诉你需要多少费用，因为我通常会把它插上电源。配对，一旦开始，很容易。只需拔下充电器的一个花蕾，它就会打开并开始寻找配对的设备。因为我一次使用一个，我发现我需要先完全关闭正在使用的那个，然后再使用另一个。我先把它们配对，然后分开。这对我来说是最好的一部分，几乎是无缝使用。总之，很高兴购买。我存了点钱去买别的东西。我已经把这些推荐给人们了（我弟弟不相信，他有他喜欢的骨导耳机）。我真的很喜欢他们。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,923,5,"i purchased the TOZO T10 wireless earbuds to workout in the pool as they were one of the few IPX8 sets available and definitely the most reasonable.  For the price, i didnt expect that much, but I was blown away by the sound quality.... crystal clear with velvety bass tones.  Reception distance was really good, there was no loss in quality at the far end of the pool.  Good to know that if I accidentally drop one in the water or it were to fall out of my ear, I can scoop it back up and keep going.  But it is doubtful that will happen as the fit is tight but comfortable. Very pleased with my purchase.  The only negative thing about this buying these is that my husband is impressed as well, so it looks like I will have to buy another pair for him to use while he is out on his kayak.  He isn't getting mine. :-)","我买了TOZO T10无线耳塞在泳池里锻炼，因为它们是为数不多的IPX8套件之一，绝对是最合理的。价格方面，我没想到会有那么高，但音质让我大吃一惊。。。。水晶般清澈，天鹅绒般的低音。接待距离真的很好，泳池的远端没有质量损失。很高兴知道如果我不小心把一个掉到水里或者它从我的耳朵里掉了出来，我可以把它舀回去继续走。但这是怀疑会发生的，因为适合是紧的，但舒适。对我的购买非常满意。买这双鞋唯一的坏处就是我丈夫也印象深刻，所以看来我得再给他买一双，让他在皮划艇上使用。他没有得到我的。:-)

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,689,5,"I absolutely love these earbuds!  I was looking at Samsung's offering since I just upgraded to a Note 9.  However,  the Tozo earbuds had much better reviews and are $100 cheaper.In the box:Very good packaging2 wireless earbuds clearly labeled for left and right.1 charging case1 pair of the smaller rubber covers and a pair of larger ones in addition to the ones included on the earbuds themselves.A 1 year extended warranty card (must activate within 14 days of receipt) - easy process using the provided car code!Detailed instructionsThe earbuds pair quickly and easily to each other and to my Note 9 with voice prompts letting you know when each is paired.  You also get a voice notification for incoming calls and when hanging up a call.The buttons are pretty tactile, however you do have to give them a bit of force.  This does help in mitigating erroneous button presses though.The earbuds fit my ears out of the box but come with various sizes so you can get the perfect fit for you.I haven't done a complete workout with these but I have worn them for hours during moderate activity and they haven't fallen out of my ears.The battery life is amazing!  I've used these for hours and they only got down to 80%.  The case conveniently charges the earbuds when they're not in use and I've only had to charge the case once after a few days use.The case itself is a little on the large side but I'll take that trade off for the amazing battery life it delivers! Although I can comfortably carry these in my pocket (I'm 6'3 and have deep Jean pockets), most might opt to carry these in a gym or laptop bag.The sound quality is decent given the price with lots of bass although I usually prefer a ""flat"" signal.  However,  I use the PI music app from the Play store which has a decent EQ so I just flatten out the signal there.  You'll definitely want to be careful not to listen to these with the volume cranked all the way up as they can get pretty loud.The range is top notch!  I think I read these are supposed to work up to 10 meters away from the paired device but I've gone further without any drop in reception.These earbuds are rated IPX8 which means they can get wet but you don't want to submerge them in water.  I've had these on in the rain with no issues.Overall,  you won't be disappointed with your purchase!  These are high quality wireless earbuds! Enjoy your music and your savings!","我绝对喜欢这些耳塞！我在看三星的产品，因为我刚刚升级到一个注9。不过，Tozo耳塞的评价要好得多，而且价格便宜100美元。包装盒内：非常好的包装2个无线耳塞，左右两侧都有清晰的标签。1个充电箱1对较小的橡胶盖和一对较大的，除了耳塞本身的外。一张1年的延长保修卡（必须在14年内激活收到日期）-使用提供的汽车代码轻松处理！详细说明耳塞可以快速轻松地配对，我的注释9中有语音提示，让您知道每一个耳塞何时配对。当你接到来电或挂断电话时，你也会收到语音通知。这些按钮触感很好，但是你必须给它们一点力量。不过，这确实有助于减少误按按钮的情况。耳塞适合我的耳朵，但大小不一，这样你就可以得到最适合你的耳塞。我还没有用这些耳塞做过完整的锻炼，但我在适度活动中戴了好几个小时，它们还没有从我的耳朵里掉出来。电池寿命惊人！我已经用了好几个小时了，它们只降到了80%。当耳塞不在使用的时候，它可以方便地为耳塞充电，而且我只需要在使用几天后为它充电一次。耳塞本身有点大，但我会用它提供的惊人的电池寿命来换取它！虽然我可以很舒服地把这些放在口袋里（我6尺3寸，有很深的牛仔裤口袋），但大多数人可能会选择把它们放在健身房或笔记本电脑包里。考虑到有很多低音的价格，音质还算不错，尽管我通常更喜欢“平”的信号。不过，我使用的是来自Play store的PI音乐应用程序，它有一个不错的EQ，所以我只是把那里的信号调平。你一定要小心，不要把音量一直调高，因为它们会变得很响。范围是一流的！我想我读到的这些耳塞应该在离配对设备10米远的地方工作，但是我没有任何接收信号下降。这些耳塞的等级是IPX8，这意味着它们可能会被弄湿，但你不想把它们浸入水中。我在雨中买的这些没有问题。总的来说，你不会对你的购买感到失望！这些是高品质的无线耳塞！享受你的音乐和存款吧！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,585,5,I'm quite happy with my new TOZO T10 so far.  The sound quality is great and the bass is good which was my biggest concern when searching for the best ones on Amazon. I'm glad a lot of reviewers mentioned about the bass quality.  It's good but not as good as my corded Scosche earyphones that i've been enjoying for years.  Then again without having the cord is wonderful and an excellent trade off.  Longer will I have to struggle with the cord getting caught on the workout machines at the gym.  Just only had it for 2 days and so far so good.  Not sure about the battery life yet so i've given it 4 stars but may renew my review later.

I would recommend this as it is a reasonable price for what it is.,"到目前为止，我对我的新款TOZO T10相当满意。音质很好，低音很好，这是我在亚马逊搜索最好的音质时最担心的。我很高兴很多评论家提到了低音的质量。它很好，但不如我多年来一直喜欢的那种带绳的烤饼耳机。再没有绳子是一个很好的交换。我还要花更长的时间才能在健身房的健身器材上挣扎。只吃了两天就好了。还不确定电池的寿命，所以我已经给了它4星，但可能会更新我的审查后。这是我第一次用无线耳机，我不得不说我对目前为止的一切都很满意。我推荐这个，因为这是一个合理的价格。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,533,5,"I researched Bluetooth earbuds for several weeks.  There are so many options and so many claims.  Reading the reviews and questions on this product, I decided to give them a try.  They had EVERYTHING that I wanted in wireless earbuds.  I wanted great sound, a charging case that could be charged with USB as well as being charged on a wireless charger, the option of using just one earbud (left or right) for phone calls, great usage time, quick charge time and good range.  Also, as with any purchase I make, I look for Seller feedback when there is a problem or defect.  These earbuds check everything on my list.  I have put them through the gambit and they met or exceeded my expectations.  They easily connect to my iPhone XR.  They effortlessly connect to each other for really good stereo sound.  They have a range of 30-35 feet in my home.  You can use the Left or Right earbud by itself.  They have a very good length of charge.  Although I don't listen to music all day long (so I can't comment on the length of time they will stay charged for a whole day of music), but I have listened to a couple of hours and used for phone calls all day long and didn't need to recharge them.  They are extremely comfortable.  I have gone to bed and discovered that I still had one in my ear.  The only problem I have had with them is that I have extremely small ear canals.  I had to purchase a set of XS ear tips (SpinFit CP100-SS 3.8mm here on Amazon).  This is no slight to these earbuds though, most people will be completely satisfied with the multiple sizes provided with the earbuds.  I would and have recommended this product to everyone.","我研究了几个星期的蓝牙耳机。有这么多的选择和这么多的要求。读了关于这个产品的评论和问题，我决定试一试。他们有我想要的无线耳机。我想要很棒的声音，一个可以用USB充电的充电箱，也可以用无线充电器充电，可以选择只使用一个耳塞（左或右）打电话，很好的使用时间，很快的充电时间和范围。此外，与我所做的任何购买一样，当有问题或缺陷时，我会寻找卖家的反馈。这些耳塞检查我名单上的所有东西。我已经让他们通过了这个游戏，他们达到或超过了我的期望。它们很容易连接到我的iPhone XR。他们毫不费力地相互连接，获得真正好的立体声效果。他们在我家有30-35英尺的范围。你可以自己用左耳或右耳。它们的充电时间很长。虽然我不整天听音乐（所以我不能评论他们一整天的音乐收费时间的长短），但我听了几个小时的音乐，整天都在打电话，不需要给他们充电。它们非常舒适。我已经上床睡觉了，发现我耳朵里还有一个。我唯一的问题是我的耳道非常小。我不得不购买一套XS耳尖（SpinFit CP100-SS 3.8毫米，亚马逊网站）。不过，这对这些耳塞来说并不小，大多数人都会对耳塞提供的多种尺寸感到完全满意。我会向所有人推荐这个产品。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,534,5,"UPDATE:TOZO is sending a new set to see if the right channel was the problem. They are trying very hard to please me, including offering a full refund (return unnecessary). I opted to try the new buds because I really like the sound and how well they stay in my ears.----------------TOZO sent me a new left channel earbud when I told them about the problem with it dropping out. Only took a week to get the new one! After resetting the earbuds according to their directions, the newly reset left channel continued to drop out like the old one. It's possible that the problem is with the right bud, but they only sent the left. Most likely it's a bad design that only works for some people in some environments.After some research it would appear that it is rare for bluetooth headphones to work right all the time, so Tozo is not unique in this aspect. I've read that Bose makes some that work, but the reviews on Amazon belie that. Since I own a set of Apple AirPods, and they work great, I know it's possible to design something that functions properly, electronically (AirPods slip out and are not water resistant).There are several reasons why wireless earbuds might drop out on the left channel, but all revolve around the signal. Bluetooth transmits the left and right channels to the right bud (master), and then the right bud sends the left channel to the left bud (slave) via another bluetooth channel. Since most heads tend to attenuate the signal, very little signal gets through skin, skull, brain, and blood. It's better to get the antennas outside the ear so the signal can go around the head, so to speak. I suspect Apple figured that out and put the antenna in that little stem that hangs out of the ear.It's sad that these TOZO earbuds don't work worth a darn since they sound rather good for bluetooth audio from an MP3 file, and wireless bluetooth is so convenient when out running, cycling, etc. So now it's back to the Apple AirPods that slip out of my ears. Ugh!","更新：TOZO正在发送一个新的集合，看看是否是正确的频道出了问题。他们正在努力取悦我，包括提供全额退款（不需要退货）。我选择尝试新的耳塞，因为我真的很喜欢它的声音和它们在我耳朵里的感觉。―――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――。只花了一个星期就拿到新的！在根据耳塞的方向重新设置耳塞后，新设置的左声道继续像旧的一样脱落。有可能是右芽出了问题，但他们只派左芽。很可能这是一个糟糕的设计，只适用于某些环境中的某些人。经过一些研究，似乎蓝牙耳机很少能一直正常工作，所以Tozo在这方面并不独特。我读过Bose做了一些有用的东西，但是亚马逊的评论却不这么认为。因为我有一套苹果AirPods，而且它们工作得很好，所以我知道可以设计一些功能正常的电子产品（AirPods滑出，不防水）。无线耳机可能会从左声道掉出来，但都是围绕信号的。蓝牙将左声道和右声道传输到右声道（主），然后右声道通过另一个蓝牙声道将左声道发送到左声道（从）。由于大多数头部倾向于减弱信号，很少有信号通过皮肤、头骨、大脑和血液。可以说，最好把天线放在耳朵外面，这样信号就可以绕过头部。我怀疑苹果公司发现了这一点，并把天线放在了挂在耳朵外面的那根小茎上。很遗憾，这些TOZO耳塞根本不管用，因为它们听起来很适合MP3文件中的蓝牙音频，而且无线蓝牙在外出跑步、骑自行车等时也很方便。所以现在又回到了苹果的AirPods上，它从耳朵里滑了出来我的耳朵。啊！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,577,5,"My previous set of bluetooth headphones had lost their ability to hold a charge, so I looked at buying new ones. I was only looking for something which would have decent sound quality and reasonable isolation, and something which would have better battery life. These were on sale, so I decided to give them a try.Not only do these fit incredibly comfortably, but the sound quality is very good. There's a tiny amount of background hiss (as is typical for actively powered headphones) but it's low enough that it doesn't interfere with my enjoyment of the music, and it does serve a purpose in letting me know they're turned on.The controls on the earbuds themselves could be a little better; I wish there were some way of controlling the volume and skipping music tracks, but it only has play/pause and an assortment of call controls.Unlike my previous earbuds, these don't play an audio indication whenever the music track changes, which is good (that was really annoying). Rather than playing little jingles on connect/disconnect, a voice speaks in English. I'd rather have a little tone but the voice prompts are pretty okay too.I also tried recording a voice memo using the microphone, and while the signal level was a bit low (meaning I might come through a bit quietly on a phone call) the sound quality was fine, and surprising considering the microphone is physically in my ear. It might have trouble dealing with background noise. We'll see.The little charging/carrying case is nicely designed. It's a bit big compared to the Apple AirPods, but it has enough battery to charge the earbuds 4 times, and it also itself can be charged wirelessly or via USB. Which is something the AirPods still can't do.All in all these are great little earbuds and are well worth the money. Even at their normal price they're orders of magnitudes less expensive than the AirPods or the Jabra Elite 65t, too.","我以前的蓝牙耳机已经失去了充电能力，所以我考虑买新的。我只想找一些有良好的音质和合理的隔音效果，以及一些电池寿命更好的东西。这些是特价的，所以我决定试一试，不仅合身舒适，而且音质也很好。有少量的背景嘶嘶声（这是主动式耳机的典型特征），但它足够低，不会影响我对音乐的欣赏，而且它确实有一个目的，就是让我知道它们已经打开了。耳塞上的控制装置本身可能会好一点；我希望有某种方法可以控制音量跳过音乐曲目，但它只有播放/暂停和各种呼叫控制。与我以前的耳塞不同，这些耳塞在音乐曲目改变时不会播放音频指示，这很好（真的很烦人）。语音不是在连接/断开连接时播放小铃声，而是用英语说话。我宁愿有一点音调，但语音提示也很好。我还试着用麦克风录制语音备忘，虽然信号电平有点低（意味着我可能会在电话中安静地通过），但音质很好，而且考虑到麦克风在我的耳朵里，令人惊讶。它可能无法处理背景噪音。我们拭目以待。这个小小的充电/携带箱设计得很好。与苹果AirPods相比，它有点大，但它有足够的电池为耳塞充电4次，而且它本身也可以通过无线或USB充电。这是AirPods仍然做不到的事情。所有这些都是伟大的小耳塞，非常值得钱。即使按正常价格，它们的数量级也比AirPods或Jabra Elite 65t便宜。

Seeing that Sony, Bose (who I love) and Samsung are selling the same type earbuds with less advertised features for hundreds of dollars more.Well, I decided to wear these in the shower - since I purchased the Amazon extended warranty I figured if anything goes wrong I am covered.  Well I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!!  They performed flawlessly - hence my long review!!I am totally satisfied with my purchase and you will be too.  YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THESE EARBUDS!!!","我把三星无线耳机放错了地方，去亚马逊寻找替代品。通常，我不相信收视率或炒作，但我决定尝试一下，因为我真的不能没有无线耳塞生活。这是一个真正的评级，所以仔细听…这些耳塞只是最好的时期！！！我在几秒钟内就把这些和我的三星手机配对了，连《快速入门指南》都没看。我看了一下包装，发现上面写着防水的。再说一次，我不相信，因为低于50美元，你通常不会得到所有广告。看到索尼、Bose（我爱的人）和三星都在销售同样类型的耳塞，但广告上的功能却少了，价格高出了几百美元。好吧，我决定在淋浴时戴上它――因为我购买了亚马逊的延长保修期，我想如果出了什么问题，我也能得到保修。我被吹走了！！！他们的表现完美无瑕-因此我的长期审查！！我对我的购买完全满意，你也会满意的。你不能用这些耳塞出错！！！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,290,5,This is more of an update to a negative review.My first pair of Ear Buds would not stay connected to any of my Apple Devices.  It’s a pain to return items when life has me busy and traveling etc. - but I was forced to do so.Now - the seller contacted me to discuss the problem.  They took control and quickly replaced the Ear Buds without any hassle or problems.  Their customer support is top quality for sure.Now - the Ear Buds are up and running.  They carry good sound quality and pair easily with all of my devices.  They come with different sized tips for the best comfort.  I am not sure about battery life but so far it’s not too bad.For the price - these things are great.Their customer service takes all of the worry about a purchase.  Buy with confidence.,"这更多的是一个负面评论的更新，我的第一对耳塞不会和我的任何苹果设备保持连接。当生活让我忙得不可开交的时候，退货是件痛苦的事，但我不得不这样做。现在，卖家联系我讨论这个问题。他们控制住了，迅速更换了耳塞，没有任何麻烦和问题。他们的客户支持肯定是一流的。现在-耳塞已经启动并运行。他们携带良好的音质，很容易与我的所有设备配对。它们有不同大小的提示，以获得最佳的舒适度。我不确定电池的续航时间，但到目前为止还不算太差。就价格而言，这些东西都很好。他们的客户服务承担了购买的所有烦恼。自信地购买。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,260,5,"Initially I was having trouble getting the earbuds to fit properly; they were sticking out where they should have been more flush with my ear opening…  After a few attempts I finally got them in right, (see bottom row of image) but it was a challenge at first; helped to stand in front of a mirror. Once you get it right it makes sense and is a snap to fit. It was my first set of Bluetooth earbuds so it was on a steep learning curve to figure it all out at once.Trying all the different sized tips (included) was useful, finally settled on the medium sized ones with good results. I found that learning to put the buds in, in front of a mirror at first was helpful, as was licking the tips for lubrication made the task easier. It takes a simple rotation of the bud to the back that locks the bud in the right position. Once you get it right and see how it fits, it gets easier.The sound is surprisingly very good quality and with good base. If it sounds too thin & tinny initially, it’s a sign that the buds are not properly positioned in the ear.I tried all the included rubber-tip fittings and settled in on the medium. The directions are ambiguous at times and I don’t know if something was lost in the translation, but it easy to figure out and they have a very responsive support team. I contacted them and was linked to several pages and videos that were very helpful.I like the product and can now listen to my Kindle books without disturbing others. Connecting with iPhone/iPad was easy. The charging unit is small enough to carry in my pocket and comes with a lanyard so you can hang around your neck. Nice little compact unit.All in all a nice addition to my pile of technology... :)","最初，我很难让耳塞合身；耳塞伸出的地方应该与我的耳朵张开时更齐平……几次尝试后，我终于把它们插对了（见图片的下一行），但一开始这是一个挑战；帮助我站在镜子前。一旦你做对了，这是有意义的，是一个很快适应。这是我的第一套蓝牙耳机，所以它在一个陡峭的学习曲线上一下子把所有的问题都解决了。尝试所有不同大小的耳塞（包括耳塞）是有用的，最后决定使用中等大小的耳塞，效果很好。我发现，一开始在镜子前学会把花蕾放进去是很有帮助的，因为舔一下花蕾的润滑油可以使任务更容易。它需要一个简单的旋转芽到后面，锁定芽在正确的位置。一旦你把它弄对了，看看它如何适合，它就变得容易多了。声音的质量出奇的好，基础也很好。如果一开始听起来太薄，太刺耳，那说明耳塞在耳朵里的位置不对。我试了所有附带的橡胶头配件，然后放在中间。方向有时模棱两可，我不知道翻译过程中是否丢失了什么，但很容易弄清楚，他们有一个反应灵敏的支持团队。我联系了他们，并链接到了一些非常有用的页面和视频，我喜欢这个产品，现在可以在不打扰别人的情况下收听我的Kindle书籍。连接iPhone/iPad很容易。充电装置很小，可以放在我的口袋里，还配有一根绳子，这样你就可以挂在脖子上了。很好的小型设备。在我那堆技术的基础上又增加了一个。。。:)

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: WHITE,253,5,"First of all, I have spent approx. 2 hrs over the past 2 weeks looking for some wireless earbuds that were reasonably priced, and actually had real reviews.  Each time I would give up out of frustration of all the fraud in the reviews on these products..  For some reason, everytime I though I found a good set up earbuds I would look into approx. 10 reviews to see if the count and star rating was real. some of the other products actually had reviews that were for a completely different product... weird trick.  But consistently I would find a high number of fake reviews.. clearly fake.. note they typically have one review.. OR if they do have multiple reviews you will see they did them all within a couple days for cheap items.  This was the only product with a high review sample size and I couldn't find any evidence in my sampling of fake reviews.  So don't believe me, actually go in and look at a bunch of reviews for this product and see for yourself.  All I would find was reviewers with high review count, many years.. So hard to fake.  I had one other set of earbuds that looked huge, had tinny sound.  SO after my long search and finding these... I am so happy.  I just received them 2 hours ago, so excited had to do a review.  I got the white ones, Sound is excellent, bass is just right, I wouldn't say too much, or too little.. just right.- But yes it does have bass so my songs actually sound like I wanted them to.  Comes with different size earbuds sleeves... I though smaller would be better … but actually found the slightly larger sleeves were best fit, they won't fall out.  Super happy with these, search is over.  One other point is these don't look dorky big in my ears, like the previous ones I tried.  I don't know if noise cancellation is working or not.. hard to tell.. I couldn't hear the TV in the room practically at all so maybe it is working.. OR its just the earbud is blocking my ear canal.. either way sounds great.  Distance is great too, I have walked 50ft away and into my garage.. only there did it start to go choppy, but was going through firedoor and wall.  Plus says there waterproof on box.. I like that for when I exercise..  Great product you will be happy..  I'm glad this seller didn't go dishonest with the reviews like all the other earbuds.  I wish amazon would do sampling of reviews by dishonest dealers and cut them out!, rather them leave me to waste my time figuring it out.7-1-19 One update on my review.  I talked about noise cancellation.  I went and used them for working out.  Found there is really no noise cancellation.  I could still hear the music and noise around when working out, but not bad.. BUT I still love the product.  In fairness I looked again and the manufacturer didn't say there is active noise cancellation, They only mentioned something to the equalivant of noise blocking.. I.E. since there is plugs in your ear canal.  So Still very happy with my purchase.  IF you are looking for active noise cancelling.. these don't have that.  BUT still the Best earbuds I could find on Amazon for a good low price.","首先，在过去的两周里，我花了大约2个小时寻找一些价格合理的无线耳塞，并且得到了真正的评价。每次我都会因为对这些产品的审查中所有的欺诈行为感到沮丧而放弃。。出于某种原因，每次我发现一个好的耳塞，我会查看大约10个评论，看看计数和星级是真的。其他一些产品的评论实际上是针对完全不同的产品。。。诡计。但一直以来，我都会发现大量的虚假评论。。显然是假的。。注意他们通常有一个评论。。或者如果他们有多个评论，你会看到他们在几天内都做了便宜的项目。这是唯一一个审查样本量高的产品，我在假审查的抽样中找不到任何证据。所以不要相信我，其实进去看看这个产品的一堆评论，自己看看。我所能找到的只是那些有着很高评价数的评论者，很多年。。很难伪造。我还有一副耳塞，看起来很大，声音很轻。所以经过我长时间的搜寻和发现。。。我很高兴。我两个小时前才收到，所以兴奋得做了一个回顾。我有白色的，声音很好，低音很好，我不会说太多，或者说太少。。很好。-但是是的，它有低音，所以我的歌听起来像是我想要的。配有不同尺寸的耳塞套。。。我觉得小一点会更好…但实际上发现稍微大一点的袖子最合适，不会掉出来。很高兴看到这些，搜索结束了。另一点是，这些在我的耳朵里看起来并不像以前那样大。我不知道噪音消除是否有效。。很难说。。我几乎听不到房间里的电视，所以也许它在工作。。或者只是耳塞堵住了我的耳道。。不管怎样听起来都不错。距离也太远了，我已经走了50英尺，进了我的车库。。只有在那里，它开始变得波涛汹涌，但正在通过防火门和墙壁。加上盒子上有防水的。。我喜欢当我锻炼的时候。。很好的产品你会很高兴的。。我很高兴这个卖家没有像其他所有的耳塞一样对评论不诚实。我希望亚马逊能对不诚实的经销商的评论进行抽样，并将其剔除！相反，他们让我浪费时间去搞清楚。7-1-19我的评论有一个更新。我说了噪音消除。我去用它们锻炼身体。发现真的没有噪音消除。我在锻炼时仍然能听到周围的音乐和噪音，但还不错。。但我还是喜欢这个产品。公平地说，我又看了一遍，制造商没有说有主动消音，他们只是提到了一些与消音相同的东西。。一、 因为你的耳道里有耳塞。所以对我的购买还是很满意的。如果你正在寻找主动噪声抵消。。这些没有。但我还是能在亚马逊上找到最好的耳塞，而且价格便宜。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,249,5,"I purchased these to listen to music or audio books on my walking commutes. They have never died on me, and my walk is 80 minutes - which is more than I can say for the last BT earbuds I had. I like the earbud receptacle/battery charger case. I not really impressed with the noise cancellation, but that's not a big deal for me (I've read that NC is primarily designed to cancel jet engine noise, and doesn't handle a wide variety of random frequencies well - what I experience walking home with traffic). These also stay in my ear better than the last set I had, which would fall out when I ran (it not fun trying to find the little buggers). They sound fine to me, but I'm not an audiophile and have some high frequency hearing, so I'm not a good judge of audio quality. I would purchase these again.","我买这些是为了在步行途中听音乐或听有声读物。他们从未在我身上死去，我的步行时间是80分钟――这比我最后一次戴上BT耳塞的时间还长。我喜欢耳塞插座/电池充电器。我对噪音消除并没有太大的印象，但这对我来说并不是什么大不了的（我读到NC主要是为了消除喷气发动机的噪音，并且不能很好地处理各种各样的随机频率――我在交通拥挤的情况下步行回家的体验）。这些也比我上次的那套更好地留在我的耳朵里，那套在我跑的时候会掉出来（想找到那些小虫子可不好玩）。他们听起来不错，但我不是一个爱听者，有一些高频听力，所以我不是一个好的判断音频质量。我想再买一次。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,252,5,"FINAL UPDATE (#2):  I am updating this review after getting to examine a 3rd pair of earbuds and finding that they were completely trouble free.  I have kept all previous reviews below for completeness sake.  Quick version:  I got a bad pair, but I was quickly sent a replacement, and have used a 3rd pair.  The 2nd and 3rd pair worked flawlessly (the first pair were clearly not the “normal” quality) so I feel compelled to update my review based on this.  I also discovered that if you have a wireless charger (like one you use with your phone), you can rest the charging case on that wireless charging pad and they charge!  That’s so convenient.  I am also finding them to be very comfortable and I enjoy the sound.  Great for the gym!UPDATE 1:  TOZO contacted me by email and sent me a new pair of earbuds.  These earbuds indeed work fine and don't have any issues at all.  I think TOZO understands the importance of reviews and very much wants people to give them good reviews.  I would say they are even a bit aggressive about their customer service. They were always incredibly polite and professional, but they wanted to be sure I got the second pair to try.  I can appreciate their hard work in trying to make sure that I walked away with good things to say about the product.  I have now given this 4 stars because the final product works great, but the fact that I got one that seems to be way too susceptible to interference won't allow me to give it 5 stars in good conscience.Bottom line:- first product worked well except for drops - but they were so frequent in certain places it was maddening- second product worked like a charm and does not seem to have any of the dropping issues- they want to be sure you are happy so the customer service was lightning fast and with no questions asked- If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive pair of Bluetooth wireless earbuds, give these a try.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  They pair easily, have a nice charging case, and seem to have a good battery life.  Unfortunately, they drop signal 3-4xs per minute.  I did a bit of troubleshooting to make sure it was the earbuds and not the device.  I paired it with several devices and the earbuds always dropped signal.  I then paired all of the devices with several other bluetooth headphones and speakers I have (including an Echo).  All of the devices played flawlessly through all of the speakers without dropping signal.  However, these drop regularly.  Sometimes it will go for a minute or two without dropping, sometimes certain places seem to make it worse, but, overall, it happens several times per minute.  It makes an otherwise decent pair of earbuds unusable.  I will return these.","最后更新（#2）：我在检查了第三对耳塞并发现它们完全没有问题之后更新了这篇评论。为了完整起见，我保留了之前所有的评论。快速版本：我得到了一个坏的对，但我很快被派了一个替代品，并使用了第三对。第二对和第三对完美无瑕（第一对显然不是“正常”的质量），所以我觉得有必要在此基础上更新我的评论。我还发现，如果你有一个无线充电器（像一个你用你的手机），你可以把充电箱放在那个无线充电垫上，他们充电！太方便了。我也发现他们非常舒适，我喜欢的声音。很适合健身房！更新1:TOZO通过电子邮件联系我，给我发了一副新耳塞。这些耳塞确实工作良好，没有任何问题。我认为TOZO理解评论的重要性，非常希望人们给他们好的评论。我想说的是，他们在客户服务方面甚至有点咄咄逼人。他们总是非常礼貌和专业，但他们想确保我有第二双试试。我可以感谢他们的辛勤工作，以确保我离开了好东西说的产品。我现在给了这4颗星，因为最终的产品效果很好，但事实上，我得到了一个似乎太容易受到干扰的方式，不允许我给它5星级的良心。底线：-第一个产品工作良好，除了滴-但他们是如此频繁，在某些地方，这是令人抓狂-第二个产品工作像一个魅力，似乎没有任何下降的问题-他们想确定你是快乐的，所以客户服务是闪电般的快，没有问题问-如果你正在寻找一对相对便宜的蓝牙无线耳塞，给这些试试。原始评论：他们很容易配对，有一个很好的充电箱，似乎有一个很好的电池寿命。不幸的是，信号每分钟下降3-4倍。我做了一些故障排除，以确保是耳塞而不是设备。我把它和几个设备配对，耳塞总是发出信号。然后我将所有设备与其他蓝牙耳机和扬声器配对（包括回声）。所有的设备在所有的扬声器中完美地播放，没有信号丢失。然而，这些下降是有规律的。有时它会持续一两分钟而没有下降，有时某些地方似乎使情况更糟，但总的来说，它每分钟发生几次。这使得一对原本体面的耳塞无法使用。我会还给你的。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,278,5,"I'll be completely honest: I did not expect anything amazing from these earbuds. In fact, I was entirely prepared to receive them, use them for a day, and send them back due to poor quality.I was happily mistaken.The Pros: Right out of the box, these earbuds looked impressive. The housings on each earpiece have a matte, somewhat tacky (in terms of texture), black finish that feels really nice. Each earbud feels light yet sturdy. There are 4 included rubber earpieces included (the medium size is attached by default). The earbuds pair automatically when taken out of the housing. The sound on these is incredible! When situated properly in the ear, these things pump out a decent layer of bass and produce a surprising clear range of mids and highs! The buds pair automatically when removed from the case, and I have yet to experience any static while listening. They also have an excellent range, and you can even keep them on while you take a shower/bath! The most satisfying part of this purchase was the $31 price tag. I'm struggling to include all of the positive aspects of these earbuds in one review!The Cons: I'm not sure I can think of any at the moment! My only gripe would be that the earbuds don't remain completely in the ear when you start to move around, particularly while running/dancing. When this happens, the sound quality is noticeably reduced (since they start to fall out).Pictured are the XL, L and S earpieces (in that order) as well as all included accessories. The M earpieces are attached to the earbuds.*Note: I have yet to really test the limits of the battery life on these. I will update my review at a later date.","我会说实话：我没想到这些耳塞会有什么惊人的效果。事实上，我完全准备好了接收它们，使用一天，然后由于质量差而将它们寄回去。我很高兴弄错了。优点：这些耳塞在开箱即用的时候看起来令人印象深刻。每个听筒的外壳都有一个哑光，有点俗气（就质地而言），黑色的表面，感觉真的很好。每个耳塞感觉轻而结实。包括4个橡胶听筒（默认情况下为中等尺寸）。耳塞从外罩中取出时会自动配对。上面的声音真不可思议！当正确地放置在耳朵，这些东西泵出一个体面的低音层，并产生一个令人惊讶的中高音清晰范围！当从箱子里取出时，芽会自动配对，而我在听的时候还没有经历过任何静电。它们的射程也很好，你甚至可以在洗澡的时候一直戴着！这次购买最令人满意的部分是31美元的标价。我正在努力把这些耳塞的所有积极方面都包括在一篇评论中！缺点：我不确定我现在能想到什么！我唯一的抱怨是，当你开始走动时，尤其是在跑步/跳舞时，耳塞不会完全留在耳朵里。当这种情况发生时，音质明显降低（因为它们开始脱落）。图中是XL、L和S耳机（按顺序排列）以及所有附带的配件。M耳机与耳塞相连。*注意：我还没有真正测试这些耳机的电池寿命限制。我稍后会更新我的评论。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,248,5,"I've been using ""wireless"" earbuds for the last few years, and although they're more convenient than wired ones the fact that they still are connected to each other with a wire pretty much still makes them a bit ""in the way."" I loved the idea of the AirPods being truly wireless and having a secure storage case that charges the earbuds but I didn't like the design of the earbuds themselves or the shape Apple uses as I prefer in-ear ones. Paired with a high price tag and average sound quality I looked on here to see what true wireless earbuds were available and the Tozo T10s stood out the most. They have the in-ear style earbud, compact charging case, and are very affordable. There are many different wireless earbuds to choose from but I really like the small design of the earbuds themselves, not too long, and don't come with any wing tips that take a bit longer to line up in your ear. Also the charging case is the perfect size, not being too tall or wide, and unlike the majority of other charging cases it can be charged wirelessly and is IPX8 waterproof. The sound quality of the earbuds is very good for my needs of connecting them to my Apple TV and iPad to watch TV shows, YouTube, and music. They usually last between 3-4 hours of listening out of the case which is great and when you do put them back in the case they charge back up very quickly and you can get several recharges out of the carrying case itself before it needs recharged, which also is very fast to charge up. The best method to have the earbuds pair to each other quickly and then to your device is to remove the Right one first, and very quickly (half a second after) remove the Left. That way the right starts searching and as soon as the left one comes on it picks it up and then immediately pairs to whatever device you're using. The only two things I don't like is since the right bud pairs to the left it counts as a connected device and then you can only connect to one other device (for example an iPhone.) It seems even bluetooth 5.0 still can only connect to 2 devices at the same time but since the left earbud counts as a connected device that really only leaves you one. So if they're paired to my Apple TV (which never shuts off) then if I want to connect them to my iPad they'll auto connect to the Apple TV if they were last used on it so I have to manually disconnect them and then they'll pair to the iPad. The buds both have a clickable button but it only does Play/Pause or answers a call, and if you long press it redials the last number you called. I rarely make calls on my iPhone and even if I do I'm not going to use the earbuds with it, I only use them for music and video, so I would prefer that the button functioned as media controls. One button can control several playback features (for example, I press is play/pause, 2 presses is skip forward, and 3 presses is skip back, and since both earbuds have a button one long press on the right could be volume up and one long press on the left is volume down.) Although it's not a big deal, I think those features could make these earbuds truly perfect and hopefully they can release a newer model with those features as I'd gladly buy another pair.","在过去的几年里，我一直在使用“无线”耳塞，虽然它们比有线耳塞更方便，但事实上它们仍然通过一根电线连接在一起，这仍然让它们有点“碍事”。我喜欢AirPods是真正无线的想法，并且有一个安全的存储盒来为耳塞充电，但我没有比如耳塞本身的设计，或者苹果在我喜欢的耳朵上使用的形状。再加上高昂的价格和平均的音质，我在这里看到了什么真正的无线耳塞是可用的，而Tozo T10最为突出。他们有入耳式耳塞，紧凑的充电箱，非常实惠。有很多不同的无线耳塞可供选择，但我真的很喜欢耳塞本身的小设计，不要太长，也不要附带任何需要更长时间才能排到耳朵里的翼尖。此外，充电箱是完美的尺寸，不是太高或太宽，不像大多数其他充电箱，它可以无线充电，是IPX8防水。耳塞的音质非常适合我将耳塞连接到苹果电视和iPad上观看电视节目、YouTube和音乐的需要。它们通常会持续3-4个小时的监听，这是很好的，当你把它们放回手机壳时，它们会很快充电，你可以在手机壳需要充电之前从手机壳中获得几次充电，充电也很快。让耳塞快速配对然后配对到您的设备的最佳方法是首先移除右侧耳塞，然后非常快（半秒后）移除左侧耳塞。这样，右边开始搜索，左边一出现，它就拿起它，然后立即配对到你正在使用的任何设备。我唯一不喜欢的两件事是，因为右边的耳机对到左边，它算是一个连接的设备，然后你只能连接到另一个设备（例如iPhone）。似乎即使是蓝牙5.0也只能同时连接到两个设备，但因为左边的耳机算是一个连接的设备，实际上只留给你一个。因此，如果它们与我的苹果电视配对（苹果电视从不关机），那么如果我想将它们连接到我的iPad，它们将自动连接到苹果电视（如果它们上次在iPad上使用），因此我必须手动断开它们的连接，然后它们将配对到iPad。这两个按钮都有一个可点击的按钮，但它只会播放/暂停或接听电话，如果你长按它会重拨你最后拨打的号码。我很少在iPhone上打电话，即使打了，我也不会把耳机和它一起用，我只把它们用在音乐和视频上，所以我更希望按钮能起到媒体控制的作用。一个按钮可以控制多个播放功能（例如，我按是播放/暂停，两次按是向前跳过，三次按是向后跳过，因为两个耳塞都有一个按钮，一次长按右边的按钮可以增大音量，一次长按左边的按钮可以减小音量），我认为这些功能可以使这些耳塞真正完美，并希望他们可以发布一个新的模式与这些功能，因为我很乐意购买另一双。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,245,5,"I've had these for about 6 months now and I love these.No more annoying wires dangling around my neck.  And no wires needed to charge this.  The case itself charges wirelessly, and the earbuds charge in the case.  This means I don't have to worry about finding a charger that fits.  No need for lightning connector, USB C, Micro USB, etc.  This charges on any wireless base there is.The sound is great too.  I admit I was worried when buying these because of the lack of wires - but the sound is better than my last pair of wired earbuds.  Definitely better than the sound from Airpods - too much noise is lost with airpods because they don't fit to the ear like earbuds do.These can get loud too, if you want that. - I never turn them up all of the way because it can get too loud for me - and I like loud music - so they get loud enough.Sound quality is great for the types of music I listen to - that includes rap, some pop, classic rock, metal like Metallica and Megadeth, harder metal like Slayer and Lamb of God.  It all sounds great.  I have Bose speakers in my car and the music with these earbuds sounds better than when I listen to the speakers in my car.Customer service is awesome too.  Fast responding and proactive customer service team.","我已经吃了6个月了，我很喜欢这些。再也没有烦人的电线挂在我脖子上了。不需要电线来充电。这个箱子本身是无线充电的，而耳塞是在箱子里充电的。这意味着我不必担心找到合适的充电器。不需要lightning连接器、USB C、Micro USB等。任何无线底座都可以充电。声音也很棒。我承认我买这些耳塞的时候很担心，因为没有电线，但是声音比我最后一副耳塞好。绝对比Airpods的声音好-Airpods失去了太多的噪音，因为它们不像耳塞那样适合耳朵。如果你想的话，这些声音也会变得很大。-我从来不会把它们一路打开，因为它对我来说太吵了――我喜欢大声的音乐――所以它们会变得足够吵。音质对我所听的音乐类型来说非常好――包括说唱、流行乐、古典摇滚、金属般的金属和大教堂、硬金属般的杀手和上帝的羔羊。听起来不错。我的车里有Bose扬声器，带耳塞的音乐听起来比我在车里听扬声器时好，客户服务也很棒。快速反应和积极主动的客户服务团队。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,0,4,"I'm one of the very, very few people who cannot use the apple air pods. No matter how hard I try, they fall out of my ear in less than a minute. I thought I would try a different brand, and when I put these in my ear, they fell out within seconds. I was about to give up, pack up the box, and send it back, but I decided to check out the instruction manual in case i was doing something wrong. I’m so happy I did. Turns out there were 4 sizes of plastic ear caps included with the earbuds. On my third try, the second smallest ones, I felt how i imagine Cinderella felt when she tried on the glass slipper. They were perfect and no matter how much I jumped up and down or shook my head, they stayed in place!The quality of sound is impeccable, nice highs and lows, with a decent amount of bass. Once I found the right match, the fit was extremely comfortable.I love these headphones, they have already changed my life for the better!","我是极少数不能使用苹果气荚的人之一。不管我怎么努力，它们不到一分钟就从我耳朵里掉了出来。我想我可以换个牌子，当我把它们放进耳朵里时，几秒钟就掉了。我正要放弃，收拾好盒子，寄回去，但我决定看看说明书，以防我做错了什么。我很高兴我做到了。原来有4种大小的塑料耳塞
在我的第三次尝试，第二次最小的尝试中，我感觉到灰姑娘试穿玻璃拖鞋时的感觉。他们是完美的，无论我跳上跳下或摇头，他们留在原地！音质无可挑剔，高音和低音都不错，低音也不错。一旦找到了合适的搭配，合身的感觉非常舒服。我喜欢这些耳机，它们已经改变了我的生活！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,0,5,"I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.","我对Tozo T10印象深刻。包装令人难以置信，建造质量是一流的，一套惊人的功能，即使价格是两倍高的价格。无线充电、IPX8防水、高质量8毫米声音驱动程序和蓝牙v5.0只是T10必须提供的高端功能中的一部分。将它们与我的手机配对太容易了
你只需要把它们从充电箱里拿出来，就可以配对了（只需简单地说一句，确保你选择ZO-T10-R，右耳塞是主要的）。蓝牙v5.0意味着他们有更强的连接和更长的距离。我可以把它们放在我的背包里，我仍然可以连接到30英尺远的地方。高音的清晰度和低音的丰满程度与最高端耳塞的质量水平相当
我个人把这些带进了淋浴间，我当时并没有洗澡，耳塞和手机壳本身都是非常防水的。我惊喜地发现，我可以用我的T10手机充电四个多小时，而且充电箱可以为耳塞充电四次。最后，我要说的是，齐无线充电箱非常方便。我可以把手机和耳塞套放在我的充电板上，我可以走了
如果你从未使用过无线充电，你需要。总之，我在市场上找不到比这更好的耳塞了。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,0,5,"Every Christmas I usually have enough personal money to make an impulse purchase, usually in Electronics. This year, I wanted to upgrade the $20 pair of totally wireless sound (TWS) earbuds I had. They were good, but needed better sound to make them perfect.With a budget of about $100, I started off looking for something good from a known manufacturer (like Samsung, Jabra, etc.) There was just nothing out there in my price range. I couldn't see myself paying that kind of money from a brand I didn't know, so I started looking for a cheaper model. For around $50 I found 3-4 that looked good and reviews were good enough. I liked Anker's other Bluetooth earphones, so the Soundcore Liberty Lites were considered. With the good reviews and previous good ownership of Monoprice products the Monoprice IPX4s were looking good, too.Due diligence and a desire to be able to use one earbud at a time drive me to search Amazon's best rated under $50 TWS sets, and Tozo looked pretty good. While the buds are labeled L and R, they are both the same, and can be put into either ear. They come with 4 tips, and for the first time, I'm not using the largest ones. So if you have really big ear canals and find it hard to get tips that fit, you may find a good fit here.The sound won't knock Bose out of the water, but for the forty dollars I paid, it is good, and an outstanding upgrade from my $20 pair. It has nice bass, and well defined mids and highs.Battery time is right around 4 hours at low volume (I wear them at work as background noise). The travel case can charge one while the other is playing, so I don't find it hard to get through a work day with them. I like the charging case, too. It's well built, and can use a Qi wireless charger, which I don't care about really. There are 4 lights to tell you how charged it is. it closes and fits in a pocket. I can't tell you how many charges it will take, because I usually keep it plugged in.Pairing, once initially done, is easy. Just pull a bud off the charger and it will turn on and start looking for your paired device. Since I'm using one at a time, I find I need to turn the one I'm using off completely first, then get the other one. I paired them first together, and then separate. This is the best part of these for me, almost seamless use.All in all, very happy with the purchase. And I save up some money to get something else. I have already recommended these to people (my brother is not convinced, he has bone conducting headphones he likes). I do like them that much.","每年圣诞节，我通常都有足够的个人资金来进行冲动购买，通常是在电子产品领域。今年，我想升级20美元的全无线耳机。它们很好，但需要更好的声音才能使它们完美。我花了大约100美元的预算，开始从一家知名制造商（如三星、雅布拉等）那里寻找一些好东西，但在我的价格范围内什么都没有
我看不到自己从一个我不知道的品牌那里花了那么多钱，所以我开始寻找一个更便宜的型号。50美元左右，我发现3-4看起来不错，评论也不错。我喜欢Anker的其他蓝牙耳机，所以考虑了Soundcore Liberty Lite。由于良好的评价和以前对单稻产品的良好所有权，单稻ipx4看起来也不错
尽职调查和一次只能使用一个耳塞的愿望驱使我去搜索亚马逊最好的50美元以下的TWS套装，而Tozo看起来相当不错。当花蕾被标记为L和R时，它们都是一样的，并且可以放在两个耳朵里。它们有4个提示，我第一次不用最大的。所以如果你的耳道真的很大，很难找到合适的建议，你可以在这里找到一个合适的
这声音不会把波西从水里打出来，但我花了40美元，这是很好的，从我的20美元一双出色的升级。它有很好的低音，清晰的中高音。在低音量下，电池时间大约为4小时（我在工作时戴着它们作为背景噪音）。旅行箱可以一边玩一边收费，所以我觉得和他们一起度过一个工作日并不难。我也喜欢充电箱
它的结构很好，可以使用一个Qi无线充电器，我真的不在乎。有4盏灯可以告诉你它的充电情况。它合上放在口袋里。我不能告诉你需要多少费用，因为我通常会把它插上电源。配对，一旦开始，很容易。只需拔下充电器的一个插头，它就会打开并开始寻找配对的设备
因为我一次使用一个，我发现我需要先完全关闭正在使用的那个，然后再使用另一个。我先把它们配对，然后分开。这对我来说是最好的一部分，几乎是无缝使用。总之，很高兴购买。我存了点钱去买别的东西。我已经把这些推荐给人们了（我弟弟不相信，他有他喜欢的骨导耳机）。我真的很喜欢他们。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,835,5,"Connected these to my fire stick, which is why I purchased it so I can watch tv while my husband is sleeping. The volume on the ToZo was extremely loud. I wasn’t able to adjust it not even with the tv or fire stick remote. The volume can only be controlled when connected to your phone or tablet. I bought this on Prime Day thinking I was getting a good deal and Paid $49.99 with $3 off but found out other purchase this for around $25/$30. Two stars because they work find when connected to a phone or table but that’s not what I purchased them for.UPDATE REVIEW...This is an update. TOZO Customer service is wonderful they reached out to me to rectify the issue. They issued another TOZO Bluetooth. The previous one works great with my devices just not with my smart tv. Haven’t tried the new one yet but Will keep you posted.  Thanks TOZO","把这些连接到我的火棍上，这就是为什么我买了它，这样我就可以在我丈夫睡觉的时候看电视。玩具曲的音量非常大。我不能调整它，即使是用电视或消防棒遥控器。只有连接到手机或平板电脑时才能控制音量。我在黄金日买了这个，以为我得到了一笔好交易，花了49.99美元，还打了3美元折扣，但发现其他人花了25美元/30美元买了这个
两颗星，因为他们的工作找到时，连接到一个电话或表，但这不是我买他们的目的。更新审查…这是一个更新。TOZO的客户服务很好，他们主动找我来解决这个问题。他们又发布了一个TOZO蓝牙。前一个很适合我的设备，只是不适合我的智能电视。还没试过新的，但会随时通知你的。多亏了佐

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,923,5,"i purchased the TOZO T10 wireless earbuds to workout in the pool as they were one of the few IPX8 sets available and definitely the most reasonable.  For the price, i didnt expect that much, but I was blown away by the sound quality.... crystal clear with velvety bass tones.  Reception distance was really good, there was no loss in quality at the far end of the pool.  Good to know that if I accidentally drop one in the water or it were to fall out of my ear, I can scoop it back up and keep going.  But it is doubtful that will happen as the fit is tight but comfortable. Very pleased with my purchase.  The only negative thing about this buying these is that my husband is impressed as well, so it looks like I will have to buy another pair for him to use while he is out on his kayak.  He isn't getting mine. :-)","我买了TOZO T10无线耳塞在泳池里锻炼，因为它们是为数不多的IPX8套件之一，绝对是最合理的。价格方面，我没想到会有那么高，但音质让我大吃一惊。。。。水晶般清澈，天鹅绒般的低音。接待距离真的很好，泳池的远端没有质量损失。很高兴知道如果我不小心把一个掉到水里或者从耳朵里掉了出来，我可以把它舀起来继续走
但这是怀疑会发生的，因为适合是紧的，但舒适。对我的购买非常满意。买这双鞋唯一的坏处就是我丈夫也印象深刻，所以看来我得再给他买一双，让他在皮划艇上使用。他没有得到我的。:-)

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,689,5,"I absolutely love these earbuds!  I was looking at Samsung's offering since I just upgraded to a Note 9.  However,  the Tozo earbuds had much better reviews and are $100 cheaper.In the box:Very good packaging2 wireless earbuds clearly labeled for left and right.1 charging case1 pair of the smaller rubber covers and a pair of larger ones in addition to the ones included on the earbuds themselves.A 1 year extended warranty card (must activate within 14 days of receipt) - easy process using the provided car code!Detailed instructionsThe earbuds pair quickly and easily to each other and to my Note 9 with voice prompts letting you know when each is paired.  You also get a voice notification for incoming calls and when hanging up a call.The buttons are pretty tactile, however you do have to give them a bit of force.  This does help in mitigating erroneous button presses though.The earbuds fit my ears out of the box but come with various sizes so you can get the perfect fit for you.I haven't done a complete workout with these but I have worn them for hours during moderate activity and they haven't fallen out of my ears.The battery life is amazing!  I've used these for hours and they only got down to 80%.  The case conveniently charges the earbuds when they're not in use and I've only had to charge the case once after a few days use.The case itself is a little on the large side but I'll take that trade off for the amazing battery life it delivers! Although I can comfortably carry these in my pocket (I'm 6'3 and have deep Jean pockets), most might opt to carry these in a gym or laptop bag.The sound quality is decent given the price with lots of bass although I usually prefer a ""flat"" signal.  However,  I use the PI music app from the Play store which has a decent EQ so I just flatten out the signal there.  You'll definitely want to be careful not to listen to these with the volume cranked all the way up as they can get pretty loud.The range is top notch!  I think I read these are supposed to work up to 10 meters away from the paired device but I've gone further without any drop in reception.These earbuds are rated IPX8 which means they can get wet but you don't want to submerge them in water.  I've had these on in the rain with no issues.Overall,  you won't be disappointed with your purchase!  These are high quality wireless earbuds! Enjoy your music and your savings!","我绝对喜欢这些耳塞！我在看三星的产品，因为我刚刚升级到一个注9。不过，Tozo耳塞的评价要好得多，价格便宜100美元。包装盒：非常好2个无线耳塞，左右两侧都有清晰的标签。1个充电盒1对较小的橡胶套和一对较大的，除了耳塞本身的外
一张1年延长保修卡（必须在收到后14天内激活）-使用提供的汽车代码可轻松处理！详细说明耳塞可以快速轻松地配对，我的注释9中有语音提示，让您知道每一个耳塞何时配对。当你接到来电或挂断电话时，你也会收到语音通知。这些按钮触感很好，但是你必须给它们一点力量。这确实有助于减少错误的按钮按下
耳塞适合我的耳朵，但有不同的尺寸，这样你就可以得到完美的适合你。我还没有完成一个完整的锻炼，但我已经穿了几个小时，在适度的活动，他们没有从我的耳朵掉出来。电池寿命是惊人的！我已经用了好几个小时了，它们只降到了80%。当耳塞不在使用时，这个箱子很方便地给它们充电，而且我只用了几天就给这个箱子充电一次
箱子本身有点大，但我会用它提供的惊人的电池寿命来交换！虽然我可以很舒服地把这些放在口袋里（我6尺3寸，有很深的牛仔裤口袋），但大多数人可能会选择把它们放在健身房或笔记本电脑包里。考虑到有很多低音的价格，音质还算不错，尽管我通常更喜欢“平”的信号。不过，我使用的是Play store的PI音乐应用程序，它有一个不错的EQ，所以我只是把那里的信号调平
你一定要小心，不要把音量一直调高，因为它们会变得很响。范围是一流的！我想我读到的这些耳塞应该在离配对设备10米远的地方工作，但是我没有任何接收信号下降。这些耳塞的等级是IPX8，这意味着它们可能会被弄湿，但你不想把它们浸入水中。我在雨中穿的这些没有问题
总的来说，你不会对你的购买感到失望！这些是高品质的无线耳塞！享受你的音乐和存款吧！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,585,5,I'm quite happy with my new TOZO T10 so far.  The sound quality is great and the bass is good which was my biggest concern when searching for the best ones on Amazon. I'm glad a lot of reviewers mentioned about the bass quality.  It's good but not as good as my corded Scosche earyphones that i've been enjoying for years.  Then again without having the cord is wonderful and an excellent trade off.  Longer will I have to struggle with the cord getting caught on the workout machines at the gym.  Just only had it for 2 days and so far so good.  Not sure about the battery life yet so i've given it 4 stars but may renew my review later.  This being my first time with a wireless earbuds I have to say i'm pretty pleased with everything so far. I would recommend this as it is a reasonable price for what it is.,"到目前为止，我对我的新款TOZO T10相当满意。音质很好，低音很好，这是我在亚马逊搜索最好的音质时最担心的。我很高兴很多评论家提到了低音的质量。它很好，但不如我多年来一直喜欢的那种带绳的烤饼耳机。再没有绳子是一个很好的交换。我还要花更长的时间才能在健身房的健身机上挣扎
只吃了两天就好了。还不确定电池的寿命，所以我已经给了它4星，但可能会更新我的审查后。这是我第一次用无线耳机，我不得不说我对目前为止的一切都很满意。我推荐这个，因为这是一个合理的价格。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,533,5,"I researched Bluetooth earbuds for several weeks.  There are so many options and so many claims.  Reading the reviews and questions on this product, I decided to give them a try.  They had EVERYTHING that I wanted in wireless earbuds.  I wanted great sound, a charging case that could be charged with USB as well as being charged on a wireless charger, the option of using just one earbud (left or right) for phone calls, great usage time, quick charge time and good range.  Also, as with any purchase I make, I look for Seller feedback when there is a problem or defect.  These earbuds check everything on my list.  I have put them through the gambit and they met or exceeded my expectations.  They easily connect to my iPhone XR.  They effortlessly connect to each other for really good stereo sound.  They have a range of 30-35 feet in my home.  You can use the Left or Right earbud by itself.  They have a very good length of charge.  Although I don't listen to music all day long (so I can't comment on the length of time they will stay charged for a whole day of music), but I have listened to a couple of hours and used for phone calls all day long and didn't need to recharge them.  They are extremely comfortable.  I have gone to bed and discovered that I still had one in my ear.  The only problem I have had with them is that I have extremely small ear canals.  I had to purchase a set of XS ear tips (SpinFit CP100-SS 3.8mm here on Amazon).  This is no slight to these earbuds though, most people will be completely satisfied with the multiple sizes provided with the earbuds.  I would and have recommended this product to everyone.","我研究了几个星期的蓝牙耳机。有这么多的选择和这么多的要求。读了关于这个产品的评论和问题，我决定试一试。他们有我想要的无线耳机。我想要很棒的声音，一个可以用USB充电的充电箱，也可以用无线充电器充电，可以选择只使用一个耳塞（左或右）打电话，很好的使用时间，很快的充电时间和范围
此外，与我所做的任何购买一样，当有问题或缺陷时，我会寻找卖家的反馈。这些耳塞检查我名单上的所有东西。我已经让他们通过了这个游戏，他们达到或超过了我的期望。它们很容易连接到我的iPhone XR。他们毫不费力地相互连接，获得真正好的立体声效果。他们在我家有30-35英尺的范围。你可以自己用左耳或右耳。它们的充电时间很长
虽然我不整天听音乐（所以我不能评论他们一整天的音乐收费时间的长短），但我听了几个小时的音乐，整天都在打电话，不需要给他们充电。它们非常舒适。我已经上床睡觉了，发现我耳朵里还有一个。我唯一的问题是我的耳道非常小。我不得不买一套XS耳尖（SpinFit CP100-SS 3
8毫米在亚马逊）。不过，这对这些耳塞来说并不小，大多数人都会对耳塞提供的多种尺寸感到完全满意。我会向所有人推荐这个产品。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,534,5,"UPDATE:TOZO is sending a new set to see if the right channel was the problem. They are trying very hard to please me, including offering a full refund (return unnecessary). I opted to try the new buds because I really like the sound and how well they stay in my ears.----------------TOZO sent me a new left channel earbud when I told them about the problem with it dropping out. Only took a week to get the new one! After resetting the earbuds according to their directions, the newly reset left channel continued to drop out like the old one. It's possible that the problem is with the right bud, but they only sent the left. Most likely it's a bad design that only works for some people in some environments.After some research it would appear that it is rare for bluetooth headphones to work right all the time, so Tozo is not unique in this aspect. I've read that Bose makes some that work, but the reviews on Amazon belie that. Since I own a set of Apple AirPods, and they work great, I know it's possible to design something that functions properly, electronically (AirPods slip out and are not water resistant).There are several reasons why wireless earbuds might drop out on the left channel, but all revolve around the signal. Bluetooth transmits the left and right channels to the right bud (master), and then the right bud sends the left channel to the left bud (slave) via another bluetooth channel. Since most heads tend to attenuate the signal, very little signal gets through skin, skull, brain, and blood. It's better to get the antennas outside the ear so the signal can go around the head, so to speak. I suspect Apple figured that out and put the antenna in that little stem that hangs out of the ear.It's sad that these TOZO earbuds don't work worth a darn since they sound rather good for bluetooth audio from an MP3 file, and wireless bluetooth is so convenient when out running, cycling, etc. So now it's back to the Apple AirPods that slip out of my ears. Ugh!","更新：TOZO正在发送一个新的集合，看看是否是正确的频道出了问题。他们正在努力取悦我，包括提供全额退款（不需要退货）。我之所以选择试用新的耳塞，是因为我真的很喜欢它的声音，喜欢它在我耳朵里的感觉。――当我告诉他们耳塞脱落的问题时，托佐送给我一个新的左声道耳塞
只花了一个星期就拿到新的！在根据耳塞的方向重新设置耳塞后，新设置的左声道继续像旧的一样脱落。有可能是右芽出了问题，但他们只派左芽。很可能这是一个糟糕的设计，只适用于某些环境中的某些人。经过一些研究，似乎蓝牙耳机很少能一直正常工作，所以Tozo在这方面不是唯一的
我读过Bose做了一些有用的东西，但是亚马逊的评论却不这么认为。因为我有一套苹果AirPods，而且它们工作得很好，所以我知道可以设计出一些功能正常的电子产品（AirPods滑出，不防水）
蓝牙将左声道和右声道传输到右声道（主），然后右声道通过另一个蓝牙声道将左声道发送到左声道（从）。由于大多数头部倾向于减弱信号，很少有信号通过皮肤、头骨、大脑和血液。可以说，最好把天线放在耳朵外面，这样信号就可以绕过头部。我怀疑苹果知道了，把天线放在耳朵外面的那根小茎上
遗憾的是，这些TOZO耳机不值得一试，因为它们听起来很适合MP3文件中的蓝牙音频，而且无线蓝牙在外出跑步、骑车等时非常方便。所以现在又回到了从我耳朵里溜出来的苹果AirPods。啊！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,577,5,"My previous set of bluetooth headphones had lost their ability to hold a charge, so I looked at buying new ones. I was only looking for something which would have decent sound quality and reasonable isolation, and something which would have better battery life. These were on sale, so I decided to give them a try.Not only do these fit incredibly comfortably, but the sound quality is very good. There's a tiny amount of background hiss (as is typical for actively powered headphones) but it's low enough that it doesn't interfere with my enjoyment of the music, and it does serve a purpose in letting me know they're turned on.The controls on the earbuds themselves could be a little better; I wish there were some way of controlling the volume and skipping music tracks, but it only has play/pause and an assortment of call controls.Unlike my previous earbuds, these don't play an audio indication whenever the music track changes, which is good (that was really annoying). Rather than playing little jingles on connect/disconnect, a voice speaks in English. I'd rather have a little tone but the voice prompts are pretty okay too.I also tried recording a voice memo using the microphone, and while the signal level was a bit low (meaning I might come through a bit quietly on a phone call) the sound quality was fine, and surprising considering the microphone is physically in my ear. It might have trouble dealing with background noise. We'll see.The little charging/carrying case is nicely designed. It's a bit big compared to the Apple AirPods, but it has enough battery to charge the earbuds 4 times, and it also itself can be charged wirelessly or via USB. Which is something the AirPods still can't do.All in all these are great little earbuds and are well worth the money. Even at their normal price they're orders of magnitudes less expensive than the AirPods or the Jabra Elite 65t, too.","我以前的蓝牙耳机已经失去了充电能力，所以我考虑买新的。我只想找一些有良好的音质和合理的隔音效果，以及一些电池寿命更好的东西。这些是特价的，所以我决定试一试。它们不仅非常合身，而且音质也非常好
有少量的背景嘶嘶声（这是主动式耳机的典型特征），但它足够低，不会影响我对音乐的欣赏，而且它确实有一个目的，就是让我知道它们已经打开了。耳塞上的控制装置本身可能会好一点；我希望有某种方法可以控制音量跳过音乐曲目，但它只有播放/暂停和各种呼叫控制
与我以前的耳塞不同的是，这些耳机不会在音乐曲目发生变化时播放音频指示，这很好（真的很烦人）。语音不是在连接/断开连接时播放小铃声，而是用英语说话。我宁愿有一点声调，但声音提示也很好
我还试着用麦克风录制语音备忘，虽然信号电平有点低（这意味着我可能会在电话中安静地通过），但音质很好，而且考虑到麦克风在我的耳朵里，我感到惊讶。它可能无法处理背景噪音。我们拭目以待。这个小小的充电/携带箱设计得很好
与苹果AirPods相比，它有点大，但它有足够的电池为耳塞充电4次，而且它本身也可以通过无线或USB充电。这是AirPods仍然做不到的事情。所有这些都是伟大的小耳塞，非常值得钱。即使按正常价格，它们的数量级也比AirPods或Jabra Elite 65t便宜。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,260,5,"Initially I was having trouble getting the earbuds to fit properly; they were sticking out where they should have been more flush with my ear opening…  After a few attempts I finally got them in right, (see bottom row of image) but it was a challenge at first; helped to stand in front of a mirror. Once you get it right it makes sense and is a snap to fit. It was my first set of Bluetooth earbuds so it was on a steep learning curve to figure it all out at once.Trying all the different sized tips (included) was useful, finally settled on the medium sized ones with good results. I found that learning to put the buds in, in front of a mirror at first was helpful, as was licking the tips for lubrication made the task easier. It takes a simple rotation of the bud to the back that locks the bud in the right position. Once you get it right and see how it fits, it gets easier.The sound is surprisingly very good quality and with good base. If it sounds too thin & tinny initially, it’s a sign that the buds are not properly positioned in the ear.I tried all the included rubber-tip fittings and settled in on the medium. The directions are ambiguous at times and I don’t know if something was lost in the translation, but it easy to figure out and they have a very responsive support team. I contacted them and was linked to several pages and videos that were very helpful.I like the product and can now listen to my Kindle books without disturbing others. Connecting with iPhone/iPad was easy. The charging unit is small enough to carry in my pocket and comes with a lanyard so you can hang around your neck. Nice little compact unit.All in all a nice addition to my pile of technology... :)","最初，我很难让耳塞合身；耳塞伸出的地方应该与我的耳朵张开时更齐平……几次尝试后，我终于把它们插对了（见图片的下一行），但一开始这是一个挑战；帮助我站在镜子前。一旦你做对了，这是有意义的，是一个很快适应。这是我第一套蓝牙耳塞，所以要想一下子搞清这一切，需要一个陡峭的学习曲线
尝试所有不同大小的小费（包括）是有用的，最终解决了中型的，并取得了良好的效果。我发现，一开始在镜子前学会把花蕾放进去是很有帮助的，因为舔一下花蕾的润滑油可以使任务更容易。它需要一个简单的旋转芽到后面，锁定芽在正确的位置。一旦你把它弄对了，看看它如何适合，它就变得容易多了。声音的质量出奇的好，基础也很好
如果一开始听起来太薄，太刺耳，那说明耳塞在耳朵里的位置不对。我试了所有附带的橡胶头配件，然后放在中间。方向有时模棱两可，我不知道翻译过程中是否丢失了什么，但很容易弄清楚，他们有一个反应灵敏的支持团队。我联系了他们，并链接到了一些非常有用的页面和视频
我喜欢这个产品，现在可以在不打扰别人的情况下听我的Kindle书了。连接iPhone/iPad很容易。充电装置很小，可以放在我的口袋里，还配有一根绳子，这样你就可以挂在脖子上了。很好的小型设备。在我那堆技术的基础上又增加了一个。。。:)

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: WHITE,253,5,"First of all, I have spent approx. 2 hrs over the past 2 weeks looking for some wireless earbuds that were reasonably priced, and actually had real reviews.  Each time I would give up out of frustration of all the fraud in the reviews on these products..  For some reason, everytime I though I found a good set up earbuds I would look into approx. 10 reviews to see if the count and star rating was real. some of the other products actually had reviews that were for a completely different product... weird trick.  But consistently I would find a high number of fake reviews.. clearly fake.. note they typically have one review.. OR if they do have multiple reviews you will see they did them all within a couple days for cheap items.  This was the only product with a high review sample size and I couldn't find any evidence in my sampling of fake reviews.  So don't believe me, actually go in and look at a bunch of reviews for this product and see for yourself.  All I would find was reviewers with high review count, many years.. So hard to fake.  I had one other set of earbuds that looked huge, had tinny sound.  SO after my long search and finding these... I am so happy.  I just received them 2 hours ago, so excited had to do a review.  I got the white ones, Sound is excellent, bass is just right, I wouldn't say too much, or too little.. just right.- But yes it does have bass so my songs actually sound like I wanted them to.  Comes with different size earbuds sleeves... I though smaller would be better … but actually found the slightly larger sleeves were best fit, they won't fall out.  Super happy with these, search is over.  One other point is these don't look dorky big in my ears, like the previous ones I tried.  I don't know if noise cancellation is working or not.. hard to tell.. I couldn't hear the TV in the room practically at all so maybe it is working.. OR its just the earbud is blocking my ear canal.. either way sounds great.  Distance is great too, I have walked 50ft away and into my garage.. only there did it start to go choppy, but was going through firedoor and wall.  Plus says there waterproof on box.. I like that for when I exercise..  Great product you will be happy..  I'm glad this seller didn't go dishonest with the reviews like all the other earbuds.  I wish amazon would do sampling of reviews by dishonest dealers and cut them out!, rather them leave me to waste my time figuring it out.7-1-19 One update on my review.  I talked about noise cancellation.  I went and used them for working out.  Found there is really no noise cancellation.  I could still hear the music and noise around when working out, but not bad.. BUT I still love the product.  In fairness I looked again and the manufacturer didn't say there is active noise cancellation, They only mentioned something to the equalivant of noise blocking.. I.E. since there is plugs in your ear canal.  So Still very happy with my purchase.  IF you are looking for active noise cancelling.. these don't have that.  BUT still the Best earbuds I could find on Amazon for a good low price.","首先，在过去的两周里，我花了大约2个小时寻找一些价格合理的无线耳塞，并且得到了真正的评价。每次我都会因为对这些产品的审查中所有的欺诈行为感到沮丧而放弃。。出于某种原因，每次我发现一个好的耳塞，我会查看大约10个评论，看看计数和星级是真的。其他一些产品的评论实际上是针对完全不同的产品。。
诡计。但一直以来，我都会发现大量的虚假评论。。显然是假的。。注意他们通常有一个评论。。或者如果他们有多个评论，你会看到他们在几天内都做了便宜的项目。这是唯一一个审查样本量高的产品，我在假审查的抽样中找不到任何证据。所以不要相信我，实际上进去看看这个产品的一堆评论，然后自己看看
我所能找到的只是那些有着很高评价数的评论者，很多年。。很难伪造。我还有一副耳塞，看起来很大，声音很轻。所以经过我长时间的搜寻和发现。。。我很高兴。我两个小时前才收到，所以兴奋得做了一个回顾。我有白色的，声音很好，低音很好，我不会说太多，或者说太少。。很好。-但是是的，它有低音，所以我的歌听起来像是我想要的
配有不同尺寸的耳塞套。。。我觉得小一点会更好…但实际上发现稍微大一点的袖子最合适，不会掉出来。很高兴看到这些，搜索结束了。另一点是，这些在我的耳朵里看起来并不像以前那样大。我不知道噪音消除是否有效。。很难说。。我几乎听不到房间里的电视，所以也许它在工作。。或者只是耳塞堵住了我的耳道。
不管怎样听起来都不错。距离也太远了，我已经走了50英尺，进了我的车库。。只有在那里，它开始变得波涛汹涌，但正在通过防火门和墙壁。加上盒子上有防水的。。我喜欢当我锻炼的时候。。很好的产品你会很高兴的。。我很高兴这个卖家没有像其他所有的耳塞一样对评论不诚实
我希望亚马逊能对不诚实的经销商的评论进行抽样，并将其剔除！相反，他们让我浪费时间去搞清楚。7-1-19我的评论有一个更新。我说了噪音消除。我去用它们锻炼身体。发现真的没有噪音消除。我在锻炼时仍然能听到周围的音乐和噪音，但还不错。。但我还是喜欢这个产品
公平地说，我又看了一遍，制造商没有说有主动消音，他们只是提到了一些与消音相同的东西。。一、 因为你的耳道里有耳塞。所以对我的购买还是很满意的。如果你正在寻找主动噪声抵消。。这些没有。但我还是能在亚马逊上找到最好的耳塞，而且价格便宜。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,249,5,"I purchased these to listen to music or audio books on my walking commutes. They have never died on me, and my walk is 80 minutes - which is more than I can say for the last BT earbuds I had. I like the earbud receptacle/battery charger case. I not really impressed with the noise cancellation, but that's not a big deal for me (I've read that NC is primarily designed to cancel jet engine noise, and doesn't handle a wide variety of random frequencies well - what I experience walking home with traffic). These also stay in my ear better than the last set I had, which would fall out when I ran (it not fun trying to find the little buggers). They sound fine to me, but I'm not an audiophile and have some high frequency hearing, so I'm not a good judge of audio quality. I would purchase these again.","我买这些是为了在步行途中听音乐或听有声读物。他们从未在我身上死去，我的步行时间是80分钟――这比我最后一次戴上BT耳塞的时间还长。我喜欢耳塞插座/电池充电器
我对噪音消除并没有太大的印象，但这对我来说并不是什么大不了的（我读到NC主要是为了消除喷气发动机的噪音，并且不能很好地处理各种各样的随机频率――我在交通拥挤的情况下步行回家的体验）。这些也比我上次的那套更好地留在我的耳朵里，那套在我跑的时候会掉出来（找那些小虫子可不好玩）
他们听起来不错，但我不是一个爱听者，有一些高频听力，所以我不是一个好的判断音频质量。我想再买一次。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,252,5,"FINAL UPDATE (#2):  I am updating this review after getting to examine a 3rd pair of earbuds and finding that they were completely trouble free.  I have kept all previous reviews below for completeness sake.  Quick version:  I got a bad pair, but I was quickly sent a replacement, and have used a 3rd pair.  The 2nd and 3rd pair worked flawlessly (the first pair were clearly not the “normal” quality) so I feel compelled to update my review based on this.  I also discovered that if you have a wireless charger (like one you use with your phone), you can rest the charging case on that wireless charging pad and they charge!  That’s so convenient.  I am also finding them to be very comfortable and I enjoy the sound.  Great for the gym!UPDATE 1:  TOZO contacted me by email and sent me a new pair of earbuds.  These earbuds indeed work fine and don't have any issues at all.  I think TOZO understands the importance of reviews and very much wants people to give them good reviews.  I would say they are even a bit aggressive about their customer service. They were always incredibly polite and professional, but they wanted to be sure I got the second pair to try.  I can appreciate their hard work in trying to make sure that I walked away with good things to say about the product.  I have now given this 4 stars because the final product works great, but the fact that I got one that seems to be way too susceptible to interference won't allow me to give it 5 stars in good conscience.Bottom line:- first product worked well except for drops - but they were so frequent in certain places it was maddening- second product worked like a charm and does not seem to have any of the dropping issues- they want to be sure you are happy so the customer service was lightning fast and with no questions asked- If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive pair of Bluetooth wireless earbuds, give these a try.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  They pair easily, have a nice charging case, and seem to have a good battery life.  Unfortunately, they drop signal 3-4xs per minute.  I did a bit of troubleshooting to make sure it was the earbuds and not the device.  I paired it with several devices and the earbuds always dropped signal.  I then paired all of the devices with several other bluetooth headphones and speakers I have (including an Echo).  All of the devices played flawlessly through all of the speakers without dropping signal.  However, these drop regularly.  Sometimes it will go for a minute or two without dropping, sometimes certain places seem to make it worse, but, overall, it happens several times per minute.  It makes an otherwise decent pair of earbuds unusable.  I will return these.","最后更新（#2）：我在检查了第三对耳塞并发现它们完全没有问题之后更新了这篇评论。为了完整起见，我保留了之前所有的评论。快速版本：我得到了一个坏的对，但我很快被派了一个替代品，并使用了第三对。第二对和第三对完美无瑕（第一对显然不是“正常”的质量），所以我觉得有必要在此基础上更新我的评论
我还发现，如果你有一个无线充电器（像一个你用你的手机），你可以把充电箱放在那个无线充电垫上，他们充电！太方便了。我也发现他们非常舒适，我喜欢的声音。很适合健身房！更新1:TOZO通过电子邮件联系我，给我发了一副新耳塞。这些耳塞确实工作良好，没有任何问题
我认为TOZO理解评论的重要性，非常希望人们给他们好的评论。我想说的是，他们在客户服务方面甚至有点咄咄逼人。他们总是非常礼貌和专业，但他们想确保我有第二双试试。我很感激他们的辛勤工作，努力确保我带着对产品的好话离开
我现在给这4颗星是因为最终的产品效果很好，但事实上，我得到的一个似乎太容易受到干扰，这不允许我凭良心给它5颗星
一句话：-第一个产品除了滴水以外都很好-但是在某些地方它们太频繁了以至于让人抓狂了-第二个产品就像一个符咒，而且似乎没有任何滴水的问题-他们想确保你很高兴，所以客户服务速度很快，没有任何问题被问到-如果你正在寻找相对便宜的蓝牙无线耳机，试试
原版评论：他们很容易配对，有一个很好的充电箱，似乎有一个很好的电池寿命。不幸的是，信号每分钟下降3-4倍。我做了一些故障排除，以确保是耳塞而不是设备。我把它和几个设备配对，耳塞总是发出信号。然后我将所有设备与其他蓝牙耳机和扬声器配对（包括回声）
所有的设备在所有的扬声器中完美地播放，没有信号丢失。然而，这些下降是有规律的。有时它会持续一两分钟而没有下降，有时某些地方似乎使情况更糟，但总的来说，它每分钟发生几次。这使得一对原本体面的耳塞无法使用。我会还给你的。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,278,5,"I'll be completely honest: I did not expect anything amazing from these earbuds. In fact, I was entirely prepared to receive them, use them for a day, and send them back due to poor quality.I was happily mistaken.The Pros: Right out of the box, these earbuds looked impressive. The housings on each earpiece have a matte, somewhat tacky (in terms of texture), black finish that feels really nice. Each earbud feels light yet sturdy. There are 4 included rubber earpieces included (the medium size is attached by default). The earbuds pair automatically when taken out of the housing. The sound on these is incredible! When situated properly in the ear, these things pump out a decent layer of bass and produce a surprising clear range of mids and highs! The buds pair automatically when removed from the case, and I have yet to experience any static while listening. They also have an excellent range, and you can even keep them on while you take a shower/bath! The most satisfying part of this purchase was the $31 price tag. I'm struggling to include all of the positive aspects of these earbuds in one review!The Cons: I'm not sure I can think of any at the moment! My only gripe would be that the earbuds don't remain completely in the ear when you start to move around, particularly while running/dancing. When this happens, the sound quality is noticeably reduced (since they start to fall out).Pictured are the XL, L and S earpieces (in that order) as well as all included accessories. The M earpieces are attached to the earbuds.*Note: I have yet to really test the limits of the battery life on these. I will update my review at a later date.","我会说实话：我没想到这些耳塞会有什么惊人的效果。事实上，我完全准备好了接收它们，使用一天，然后由于质量差而将它们寄回去。我很高兴弄错了。优点：这些耳塞在开箱即用的时候看起来令人印象深刻。每个听筒的外壳都有一个哑光，有点俗气（就质地而言），黑色的表面，感觉真的很好。每个耳塞感觉轻而结实
包括4个橡胶听筒（默认情况下为中等尺寸）。耳塞从外罩中取出时会自动配对。上面的声音真不可思议！当正确地放置在耳朵，这些东西泵出一个体面的低音层，并产生一个令人惊讶的中高音清晰范围！当从箱子里取出时，芽会自动配对，而我在听的时候还没有经历过任何静电
它们的射程也很好，你甚至可以在洗澡的时候一直戴着！这次购买最令人满意的部分是31美元的标价。我正在努力把这些耳塞的所有积极方面都包括在一篇评论中！缺点：我不确定我现在能想到什么！我唯一的抱怨是，当你开始走动时，尤其是在跑步/跳舞时，耳塞不会完全留在耳朵里
当这种情况发生时，音质明显降低（因为它们开始脱落）。图中是XL、L和S耳机（按顺序排列）以及所有附带的配件。M耳机与耳塞相连。*注意：我还没有真正测试这些耳机的电池寿命限制。我稍后会更新我的评论。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,248,5,"I've been using ""wireless"" earbuds for the last few years, and although they're more convenient than wired ones the fact that they still are connected to each other with a wire pretty much still makes them a bit ""in the way."" I loved the idea of the AirPods being truly wireless and having a secure storage case that charges the earbuds but I didn't like the design of the earbuds themselves or the shape Apple uses as I prefer in-ear ones. Paired with a high price tag and average sound quality I looked on here to see what true wireless earbuds were available and the Tozo T10s stood out the most. They have the in-ear style earbud, compact charging case, and are very affordable. There are many different wireless earbuds to choose from but I really like the small design of the earbuds themselves, not too long, and don't come with any wing tips that take a bit longer to line up in your ear. Also the charging case is the perfect size, not being too tall or wide, and unlike the majority of other charging cases it can be charged wirelessly and is IPX8 waterproof. The sound quality of the earbuds is very good for my needs of connecting them to my Apple TV and iPad to watch TV shows, YouTube, and music. They usually last between 3-4 hours of listening out of the case which is great and when you do put them back in the case they charge back up very quickly and you can get several recharges out of the carrying case itself before it needs recharged, which also is very fast to charge up. The best method to have the earbuds pair to each other quickly and then to your device is to remove the Right one first, and very quickly (half a second after) remove the Left. That way the right starts searching and as soon as the left one comes on it picks it up and then immediately pairs to whatever device you're using. The only two things I don't like is since the right bud pairs to the left it counts as a connected device and then you can only connect to one other device (for example an iPhone.) It seems even bluetooth 5.0 still can only connect to 2 devices at the same time but since the left earbud counts as a connected device that really only leaves you one. So if they're paired to my Apple TV (which never shuts off) then if I want to connect them to my iPad they'll auto connect to the Apple TV if they were last used on it so I have to manually disconnect them and then they'll pair to the iPad. The buds both have a clickable button but it only does Play/Pause or answers a call, and if you long press it redials the last number you called. I rarely make calls on my iPhone and even if I do I'm not going to use the earbuds with it, I only use them for music and video, so I would prefer that the button functioned as media controls. One button can control several playback features (for example, I press is play/pause, 2 presses is skip forward, and 3 presses is skip back, and since both earbuds have a button one long press on the right could be volume up and one long press on the left is volume down.) Although it's not a big deal, I think those features could make these earbuds truly perfect and hopefully they can release a newer model with those features as I'd gladly buy another pair.","在过去的几年里，我一直在使用“无线”耳塞，虽然它们比有线耳塞更方便，但事实上它们仍然通过一根电线连接在一起，这仍然让它们有点“碍事”。我喜欢AirPods是真正无线的想法，并且有一个安全的存储盒来为耳塞充电，但我没有就像耳塞本身的设计或者苹果在我喜欢的耳朵上使用的形状
再加上高昂的价格和平均的音质，我在这里看到了什么真正的无线耳塞是可用的，而Tozo T10最为突出。他们有入耳式耳塞，紧凑的充电箱，非常实惠。有很多不同的无线耳塞可供选择，但我真的很喜欢耳塞本身的小设计，不要太长，也不要带任何翼尖，在你的耳朵里排成一行需要更长时间
此外，充电箱是完美的尺寸，不是太高或太宽，不像大多数其他充电箱，它可以无线充电，是IPX8防水。耳塞的音质非常适合我将耳塞连接到苹果电视和iPad上观看电视节目、YouTube和音乐的需要
它们通常会持续3-4个小时的监听，这是很好的，当你把它们放回手机壳时，它们会很快充电，你可以在手机壳需要充电之前从手机壳中获得几次充电，充电也很快。最好的方法是先把右边的耳塞取下，然后再把左边的耳塞取下
这样，右边开始搜索，左边一出现，它就拿起它，然后立即配对到你正在使用的任何设备。我唯一不喜欢的两件事是，因为右边的耳机对到左边，它算是一个连接的设备，然后你只能连接到另一个设备（例如iPhone）。看起来即使是蓝牙5.0也只能同时连接到两个设备，但因为左边的耳机算是一个连接的设备，实际上只留给你一个
因此，如果它们与我的苹果电视配对（苹果电视从不关机），那么如果我想将它们连接到我的iPad，它们将自动连接到苹果电视（如果它们上次在iPad上使用），因此我必须手动断开它们的连接，然后它们将配对到iPad。两个按键都有一个可点击的按钮，但它只能播放/暂停或接听来电，如果长按它，则会重拨上次拨打的号码
我很少在iPhone上打电话，即使打了，我也不会把耳机和它一起用，我只把它们用在音乐和视频上，所以我更希望按钮能起到媒体控制的作用。一个按钮可以控制多个播放功能（例如，我按下是播放/暂停，两次按下是向前跳，三次按下是向后跳，因为两个耳塞都有一个按钮，一个长按在右边可以增大音量，一个长按在左边可以减小音量
)虽然这不是什么大不了的事，但我认为这些功能可以使这些耳塞真正完美，希望它们能发布一款具有这些功能的新机型，因为我很乐意再购买一副。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,0,4,"I'm one of the very, very few people who cannot use the apple air pods. No matter how hard I try, they fall out of my ear in less than a minute. I thought I would try a different brand, and when I put these in my ear, they fell out within seconds. I was about to give up, pack up the box, and send it back, but I decided to check out the instruction manual in case i was doing something wrong. I’m so happy I did. Turns out there were 4 sizes of plastic ear caps included with the earbuds. On my third try, the second smallest ones, I felt how i imagine Cinderella felt when she tried on the glass slipper. They were perfect and no matter how much I jumped up and down or shook my head, they stayed in place!The quality of sound is impeccable, nice highs and lows, with a decent amount of bass. Once I found the right match, the fit was extremely comfortable.I love these headphones, they have already changed my life for the better!","我是极少数不能使用苹果气荚的人之一。不管我怎么努力，它们不到一分钟就从我耳朵里掉了出来。我想我可以换个牌子，当我把它们放进耳朵里时，几秒钟就掉了。我正要放弃，收拾好盒子，寄回去，但我决定看看说明书，以防我做错了什么。我很高兴我做到了。原来有4种大小的塑料耳塞
在我的第三次尝试，第二次最小的尝试中，我感觉到灰姑娘试穿玻璃拖鞋时的感觉。他们是完美的，无论我跳上跳下或摇头，他们留在原地！音质无可挑剔，高音和低音都不错，低音也不错。一旦找到了合适的搭配，合身的感觉非常舒服。我喜欢这些耳机，它们已经改变了我的生活！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,0,5,"I was thoroughly impressed with the Tozo T10. The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproofing, high quality 8mm sound driver, and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features the T10's have to offer.Pairing them with my phone was too easy. All you have to do is take them out of the charging case and they are ready for pairing( just a quick note make sure you choose TOZO-T10-R, the right earbud is the primary). The bluetooth v5.0 mean they have a stronger connection and longer distance. I can leave them in my backpack and I am still connected up to 30 feet away. The clarity of the highs and the richness of the bass are of the quality level of the highest end earbuds. I have personally taken these into the shower, I wasn't actually showering at the time, both of the earbuds and the case itself are extremely water resistance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could use my T10s for a little over four hours and the charging case is good for four full recharges of the earbuds. Finally, I have to say the Qi wireless chargeable case is very handy. I can set my phone and earbud case on my Qi charging pad and I'm good to go. If you have never used wireless charging, you need to. All in all for the price I could not find a better earbud on the market.","我对Tozo T10印象深刻。包装令人难以置信，建造质量是一流的，一套惊人的功能，即使价格是两倍高的价格。无线充电、IPX8防水、高质量8毫米声音驱动程序和蓝牙v5.0只是T10必须提供的高端功能中的一部分。将它们与我的手机配对太容易了
你只需要把它们从充电箱里拿出来，就可以配对了（只需简单地说一句，确保你选择ZO-T10-R，右耳塞是主要的）。蓝牙v5.0意味着他们有更强的连接和更长的距离。我可以把它们放在我的背包里，我仍然可以连接到30英尺远的地方。高音的清晰度和低音的丰满程度与最高端耳塞的质量水平相当
我个人把这些带进了淋浴间，我当时并没有洗澡，耳塞和手机壳本身都是非常防水的。我惊喜地发现，我可以用我的T10手机充电四个多小时，而且充电箱可以为耳塞充电四次。最后，我要说的是，齐无线充电箱非常方便。我可以把手机和耳塞套放在我的充电板上，我可以走了
如果你从未使用过无线充电，你需要。总之，我在市场上找不到比这更好的耳塞了。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,0,5,"Every Christmas I usually have enough personal money to make an impulse purchase, usually in Electronics. This year, I wanted to upgrade the $20 pair of totally wireless sound (TWS) earbuds I had. They were good, but needed better sound to make them perfect.With a budget of about $100, I started off looking for something good from a known manufacturer (like Samsung, Jabra, etc.) There was just nothing out there in my price range. I couldn't see myself paying that kind of money from a brand I didn't know, so I started looking for a cheaper model. For around $50 I found 3-4 that looked good and reviews were good enough. I liked Anker's other Bluetooth earphones, so the Soundcore Liberty Lites were considered. With the good reviews and previous good ownership of Monoprice products the Monoprice IPX4s were looking good, too.Due diligence and a desire to be able to use one earbud at a time drive me to search Amazon's best rated under $50 TWS sets, and Tozo looked pretty good. While the buds are labeled L and R, they are both the same, and can be put into either ear. They come with 4 tips, and for the first time, I'm not using the largest ones. So if you have really big ear canals and find it hard to get tips that fit, you may find a good fit here.The sound won't knock Bose out of the water, but for the forty dollars I paid, it is good, and an outstanding upgrade from my $20 pair. It has nice bass, and well defined mids and highs.Battery time is right around 4 hours at low volume (I wear them at work as background noise). The travel case can charge one while the other is playing, so I don't find it hard to get through a work day with them. I like the charging case, too. It's well built, and can use a Qi wireless charger, which I don't care about really. There are 4 lights to tell you how charged it is. it closes and fits in a pocket. I can't tell you how many charges it will take, because I usually keep it plugged in.Pairing, once initially done, is easy. Just pull a bud off the charger and it will turn on and start looking for your paired device. Since I'm using one at a time, I find I need to turn the one I'm using off completely first, then get the other one. I paired them first together, and then separate. This is the best part of these for me, almost seamless use.All in all, very happy with the purchase. And I save up some money to get something else. I have already recommended these to people (my brother is not convinced, he has bone conducting headphones he likes). I do like them that much.","每年圣诞节，我通常都有足够的个人资金来进行冲动购买，通常是在电子产品领域。今年，我想升级20美元的全无线耳机。它们很好，但需要更好的声音才能使它们完美。我花了大约100美元的预算，开始从一家知名制造商（如三星、雅布拉等）那里寻找一些好东西，但在我的价格范围内什么都没有
我看不到自己从一个我不知道的品牌那里花了那么多钱，所以我开始寻找一个更便宜的型号。50美元左右，我发现3-4看起来不错，评论也不错。我喜欢Anker的其他蓝牙耳机，所以考虑了Soundcore Liberty Lite。由于良好的评价和以前对单稻产品的良好所有权，单稻ipx4看起来也不错
尽职调查和一次只能使用一个耳塞的愿望驱使我去搜索亚马逊最好的50美元以下的TWS套装，而Tozo看起来相当不错。当花蕾被标记为L和R时，它们都是一样的，并且可以放在两个耳朵里。它们有4个提示，我第一次不用最大的。所以如果你的耳道真的很大，很难找到合适的建议，你可以在这里找到一个合适的
这声音不会把波西从水里打出来，但我花了40美元，这是很好的，从我的20美元一双出色的升级。它有很好的低音，清晰的中高音。在低音量下，电池时间大约为4小时（我在工作时戴着它们作为背景噪音）。旅行箱可以一边玩一边收费，所以我觉得和他们一起度过一个工作日并不难。我也喜欢充电箱
它的结构很好，可以使用一个Qi无线充电器，我真的不在乎。有4盏灯可以告诉你它的充电情况。它合上放在口袋里。我不能告诉你需要多少费用，因为我通常会把它插上电源。配对，一旦开始，很容易。只需拔下充电器的一个插头，它就会打开并开始寻找配对的设备
因为我一次使用一个，我发现我需要先完全关闭正在使用的那个，然后再使用另一个。我先把它们配对，然后分开。这对我来说是最好的一部分，几乎是无缝使用。总之，很高兴购买。我存了点钱去买别的东西。我已经把这些推荐给人们了（我弟弟不相信，他有他喜欢的骨导耳机）。我真的很喜欢他们。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,835,5,"Connected these to my fire stick, which is why I purchased it so I can watch tv while my husband is sleeping. The volume on the ToZo was extremely loud. I wasn’t able to adjust it not even with the tv or fire stick remote. The volume can only be controlled when connected to your phone or tablet.

Two stars because they work find when connected to a phone or table but that’s not what I purchased them for.UPDATE REVIEW...This is an update. TOZO Customer service is wonderful they reached out to me to rectify the issue. They issued another TOZO Bluetooth. The previous one works great with my devices just not with my smart tv. Haven’t tried the new one yet but Will keep you posted.  Thanks TOZO","把这些连接到我的火棍上，这就是为什么我买了它，这样我就可以在我丈夫睡觉的时候看电视。玩具曲的音量非常大。我不能调整它，即使是用电视或消防棒遥控器。只有连接到手机或平板电脑时才能控制音量。我在黄金日买了这个，以为我得到了一笔好交易，花了49.99美元，还打了3美元折扣，但发现其他人花了25美元/30美元买了这个
两颗星，因为他们的工作找到时，连接到一个电话或表，但这不是我买他们的目的。更新审查…这是一个更新。TOZO的客户服务很好，他们主动找我来解决这个问题。他们又发布了一个TOZO蓝牙。前一个很适合我的设备，只是不适合我的智能电视。还没试过新的，但会随时通知你的。多亏了佐

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,923,5,"i purchased the TOZO T10 wireless earbuds to workout in the pool as they were one of the few IPX8 sets available and definitely the most reasonable.  For the price, i didnt expect that much, but I was blown away by the sound quality.... crystal clear with velvety bass tones.  Reception distance was really good, there was no loss in quality at the far end of the pool.  Good to know that if I accidentally drop one in the water or it were to fall out of my ear, I can scoop it back up and keep going.  But it is doubtful that will happen as the fit is tight but comfortable. Very pleased with my purchase.  The only negative thing about this buying these is that my husband is impressed as well, so it looks like I will have to buy another pair for him to use while he is out on his kayak.  He isn't getting mine. :-)","我买了TOZO T10无线耳塞在泳池里锻炼，因为它们是为数不多的IPX8套件之一，绝对是最合理的。价格方面，我没想到会有那么高，但音质让我大吃一惊。。。。水晶般清澈，天鹅绒般的低音。接待距离真的很好，泳池的远端没有质量损失。很高兴知道如果我不小心把一个掉到水里或者从耳朵里掉了出来，我可以把它舀起来继续走
但这是怀疑会发生的，因为适合是紧的，但舒适。对我的购买非常满意。买这双鞋唯一的坏处就是我丈夫也印象深刻，所以看来我得再给他买一双，让他在皮划艇上使用。他没有得到我的。:-)

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,689,5,"I absolutely love these earbuds!  I was looking at Samsung's offering since I just upgraded to a Note 9.  However,  the Tozo earbuds had much better reviews and are $100 cheaper.In the box:Very good packaging2 wireless earbuds clearly labeled for left and right.1 charging case1 pair of the smaller rubber covers and a pair of larger ones in addition to the ones included on the earbuds themselves.A 1 year extended warranty card (must activate within 14 days of receipt) - easy process using the provided car code!Detailed instructionsThe earbuds pair quickly and easily to each other and to my Note 9 with voice prompts letting you know when each is paired.  You also get a voice notification for incoming calls and when hanging up a call.The buttons are pretty tactile, however you do have to give them a bit of force.  This does help in mitigating erroneous button presses though.The earbuds fit my ears out of the box but come with various sizes so you can get the perfect fit for you.I haven't done a complete workout with these but I have worn them for hours during moderate activity and they haven't fallen out of my ears.The battery life is amazing!  I've used these for hours and they only got down to 80%.  The case conveniently charges the earbuds when they're not in use and I've only had to charge the case once after a few days use.The case itself is a little on the large side but I'll take that trade off for the amazing battery life it delivers! Although I can comfortably carry these in my pocket (I'm 6'3 and have deep Jean pockets), most might opt to carry these in a gym or laptop bag.The sound quality is decent given the price with lots of bass although I usually prefer a ""flat"" signal.  However,  I use the PI music app from the Play store which has a decent EQ so I just flatten out the signal there.  You'll definitely want to be careful not to listen to these with the volume cranked all the way up as they can get pretty loud.The range is top notch!  I think I read these are supposed to work up to 10 meters away from the paired device but I've gone further without any drop in reception.These earbuds are rated IPX8 which means they can get wet but you don't want to submerge them in water.  I've had these on in the rain with no issues.Overall,  you won't be disappointed with your purchase!  These are high quality wireless earbuds! Enjoy your music and your savings!","我绝对喜欢这些耳塞！我在看三星的产品，因为我刚刚升级到一个注9。不过，Tozo耳塞的评价要好得多，价格便宜100美元。包装盒：非常好2个无线耳塞，左右两侧都有清晰的标签。1个充电盒1对较小的橡胶套和一对较大的，除了耳塞本身的外
一张1年延长保修卡（必须在收到后14天内激活）-使用提供的汽车代码可轻松处理！详细说明耳塞可以快速轻松地配对，我的注释9中有语音提示，让您知道每一个耳塞何时配对。当你接到来电或挂断电话时，你也会收到语音通知。这些按钮触感很好，但是你必须给它们一点力量。这确实有助于减少错误的按钮按下
耳塞适合我的耳朵，但有不同的尺寸，这样你就可以得到完美的适合你。我还没有完成一个完整的锻炼，但我已经穿了几个小时，在适度的活动，他们没有从我的耳朵掉出来。电池寿命是惊人的！我已经用了好几个小时了，它们只降到了80%。当耳塞不在使用时，这个箱子很方便地给它们充电，而且我只用了几天就给这个箱子充电一次
箱子本身有点大，但我会用它提供的惊人的电池寿命来交换！虽然我可以很舒服地把这些放在口袋里（我6尺3寸，有很深的牛仔裤口袋），但大多数人可能会选择把它们放在健身房或笔记本电脑包里。考虑到有很多低音的价格，音质还算不错，尽管我通常更喜欢“平”的信号。不过，我使用的是Play store的PI音乐应用程序，它有一个不错的EQ，所以我只是把那里的信号调平
你一定要小心，不要把音量一直调高，因为它们会变得很响。范围是一流的！我想我读到的这些耳塞应该在离配对设备10米远的地方工作，但是我没有任何接收信号下降。这些耳塞的等级是IPX8，这意味着它们可能会被弄湿，但你不想把它们浸入水中。我在雨中穿的这些没有问题
总的来说，你不会对你的购买感到失望！这些是高品质的无线耳塞！享受你的音乐和存款吧！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,585,5,I'm quite happy with my new TOZO T10 so far.  The sound quality is great and the bass is good which was my biggest concern when searching for the best ones on Amazon. I'm glad a lot of reviewers mentioned about the bass quality.  It's good but not as good as my corded Scosche earyphones that i've been enjoying for years.  Then again without having the cord is wonderful and an excellent trade off.  Longer will I have to struggle with the cord getting caught on the workout machines at the gym.  Just only had it for 2 days and so far so good.  Not sure about the battery life yet so i've given it 4 stars but may renew my review later.  This being my first time with a wireless earbuds I have to say i'm pretty pleased with everything so far. I would recommend this as it is a reasonable price for what it is.,"到目前为止，我对我的新款TOZO T10相当满意。音质很好，低音很好，这是我在亚马逊搜索最好的音质时最担心的。我很高兴很多评论家提到了低音的质量。它很好，但不如我多年来一直喜欢的那种带绳的烤饼耳机。再没有绳子是一个很好的交换。我还要花更长的时间才能在健身房的健身机上挣扎
只吃了两天就好了。还不确定电池的寿命，所以我已经给了它4星，但可能会更新我的审查后。这是我第一次用无线耳机，我不得不说我对目前为止的一切都很满意。我推荐这个，因为这是一个合理的价格。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,533,5,"I researched Bluetooth earbuds for several weeks.  There are so many options and so many claims.  Reading the reviews and questions on this product, I decided to give them a try.  They had EVERYTHING that I wanted in wireless earbuds.  I wanted great sound, a charging case that could be charged with USB as well as being charged on a wireless charger, the option of using just one earbud (left or right) for phone calls, great usage time, quick charge time and good range.  Also, as with any purchase I make, I look for Seller feedback when there is a problem or defect.  These earbuds check everything on my list.  I have put them through the gambit and they met or exceeded my expectations.  They easily connect to my iPhone XR.  They effortlessly connect to each other for really good stereo sound.  They have a range of 30-35 feet in my home.  You can use the Left or Right earbud by itself.  They have a very good length of charge.  Although I don't listen to music all day long (so I can't comment on the length of time they will stay charged for a whole day of music), but I have listened to a couple of hours and used for phone calls all day long and didn't need to recharge them.  They are extremely comfortable.  I have gone to bed and discovered that I still had one in my ear.  The only problem I have had with them is that I have extremely small ear canals.  I had to purchase a set of XS ear tips (SpinFit CP100-SS 3.8mm here on Amazon).  This is no slight to these earbuds though, most people will be completely satisfied with the multiple sizes provided with the earbuds.  I would and have recommended this product to everyone.","我研究了几个星期的蓝牙耳机。有这么多的选择和这么多的要求。读了关于这个产品的评论和问题，我决定试一试。他们有我想要的无线耳机。我想要很棒的声音，一个可以用USB充电的充电箱，也可以用无线充电器充电，可以选择只使用一个耳塞（左或右）打电话，很好的使用时间，很快的充电时间和范围
此外，与我所做的任何购买一样，当有问题或缺陷时，我会寻找卖家的反馈。这些耳塞检查我名单上的所有东西。我已经让他们通过了这个游戏，他们达到或超过了我的期望。它们很容易连接到我的iPhone XR。他们毫不费力地相互连接，获得真正好的立体声效果。他们在我家有30-35英尺的范围。你可以自己用左耳或右耳。它们的充电时间很长
虽然我不整天听音乐（所以我不能评论他们一整天的音乐收费时间的长短），但我听了几个小时的音乐，整天都在打电话，不需要给他们充电。它们非常舒适。我已经上床睡觉了，发现我耳朵里还有一个。我唯一的问题是我的耳道非常小。我不得不买一套XS耳尖（SpinFit CP100-SS 3
8毫米在亚马逊）。不过，这对这些耳塞来说并不小，大多数人都会对耳塞提供的多种尺寸感到完全满意。我会向所有人推荐这个产品。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,534,5,"UPDATE:TOZO is sending a new set to see if the right channel was the problem. They are trying very hard to please me, including offering a full refund (return unnecessary). I opted to try the new buds because I really like the sound and how well they stay in my ears.----------------TOZO sent me a new left channel earbud when I told them about the problem with it dropping out. Only took a week to get the new one! After resetting the earbuds according to their directions, the newly reset left channel continued to drop out like the old one. It's possible that the problem is with the right bud, but they only sent the left. Most likely it's a bad design that only works for some people in some environments.After some research it would appear that it is rare for bluetooth headphones to work right all the time, so Tozo is not unique in this aspect. I've read that Bose makes some that work, but the reviews on Amazon belie that. Since I own a set of Apple AirPods, and they work great, I know it's possible to design something that functions properly, electronically (AirPods slip out and are not water resistant).There are several reasons why wireless earbuds might drop out on the left channel, but all revolve around the signal. Bluetooth transmits the left and right channels to the right bud (master), and then the right bud sends the left channel to the left bud (slave) via another bluetooth channel. Since most heads tend to attenuate the signal, very little signal gets through skin, skull, brain, and blood. It's better to get the antennas outside the ear so the signal can go around the head, so to speak. I suspect Apple figured that out and put the antenna in that little stem that hangs out of the ear.It's sad that these TOZO earbuds don't work worth a darn since they sound rather good for bluetooth audio from an MP3 file, and wireless bluetooth is so convenient when out running, cycling, etc. So now it's back to the Apple AirPods that slip out of my ears. Ugh!","更新：TOZO正在发送一个新的集合，看看是否是正确的频道出了问题。他们正在努力取悦我，包括提供全额退款（不需要退货）。我之所以选择试用新的耳塞，是因为我真的很喜欢它的声音，喜欢它在我耳朵里的感觉。――当我告诉他们耳塞脱落的问题时，托佐送给我一个新的左声道耳塞
只花了一个星期就拿到新的！在根据耳塞的方向重新设置耳塞后，新设置的左声道继续像旧的一样脱落。有可能是右芽出了问题，但他们只派左芽。很可能这是一个糟糕的设计，只适用于某些环境中的某些人。经过一些研究，似乎蓝牙耳机很少能一直正常工作，所以Tozo在这方面不是唯一的
我读过Bose做了一些有用的东西，但是亚马逊的评论却不这么认为。因为我有一套苹果AirPods，而且它们工作得很好，所以我知道可以设计出一些功能正常的电子产品（AirPods滑出，不防水）
蓝牙将左声道和右声道传输到右声道（主），然后右声道通过另一个蓝牙声道将左声道发送到左声道（从）。由于大多数头部倾向于减弱信号，很少有信号通过皮肤、头骨、大脑和血液。可以说，最好把天线放在耳朵外面，这样信号就可以绕过头部。我怀疑苹果知道了，把天线放在耳朵外面的那根小茎上
遗憾的是，这些TOZO耳机不值得一试，因为它们听起来很适合MP3文件中的蓝牙音频，而且无线蓝牙在外出跑步、骑车等时非常方便。所以现在又回到了从我耳朵里溜出来的苹果AirPods。啊！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,577,5,"My previous set of bluetooth headphones had lost their ability to hold a charge, so I looked at buying new ones. I was only looking for something which would have decent sound quality and reasonable isolation, and something which would have better battery life. These were on sale, so I decided to give them a try.Not only do these fit incredibly comfortably, but the sound quality is very good. There's a tiny amount of background hiss (as is typical for actively powered headphones) but it's low enough that it doesn't interfere with my enjoyment of the music, and it does serve a purpose in letting me know they're turned on.The controls on the earbuds themselves could be a little better; I wish there were some way of controlling the volume and skipping music tracks, but it only has play/pause and an assortment of call controls.Unlike my previous earbuds, these don't play an audio indication whenever the music track changes, which is good (that was really annoying). Rather than playing little jingles on connect/disconnect, a voice speaks in English. I'd rather have a little tone but the voice prompts are pretty okay too.I also tried recording a voice memo using the microphone, and while the signal level was a bit low (meaning I might come through a bit quietly on a phone call) the sound quality was fine, and surprising considering the microphone is physically in my ear. It might have trouble dealing with background noise. We'll see.The little charging/carrying case is nicely designed. It's a bit big compared to the Apple AirPods, but it has enough battery to charge the earbuds 4 times, and it also itself can be charged wirelessly or via USB. Which is something the AirPods still can't do.All in all these are great little earbuds and are well worth the money. Even at their normal price they're orders of magnitudes less expensive than the AirPods or the Jabra Elite 65t, too.","我以前的蓝牙耳机已经失去了充电能力，所以我考虑买新的。我只想找一些有良好的音质和合理的隔音效果，以及一些电池寿命更好的东西。这些是特价的，所以我决定试一试。它们不仅非常合身，而且音质也非常好
有少量的背景嘶嘶声（这是主动式耳机的典型特征），但它足够低，不会影响我对音乐的欣赏，而且它确实有一个目的，就是让我知道它们已经打开了。耳塞上的控制装置本身可能会好一点；我希望有某种方法可以控制音量跳过音乐曲目，但它只有播放/暂停和各种呼叫控制
与我以前的耳塞不同的是，这些耳机不会在音乐曲目发生变化时播放音频指示，这很好（真的很烦人）。语音不是在连接/断开连接时播放小铃声，而是用英语说话。我宁愿有一点声调，但声音提示也很好
我还试着用麦克风录制语音备忘，虽然信号电平有点低（这意味着我可能会在电话中安静地通过），但音质很好，而且考虑到麦克风在我的耳朵里，我感到惊讶。它可能无法处理背景噪音。我们拭目以待。这个小小的充电/携带箱设计得很好
与苹果AirPods相比，它有点大，但它有足够的电池为耳塞充电4次，而且它本身也可以通过无线或USB充电。这是AirPods仍然做不到的事情。所有这些都是伟大的小耳塞，非常值得钱。即使按正常价格，它们的数量级也比AirPods或Jabra Elite 65t便宜。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,297,5,"I misplaced my Samsung wireless earbuds and went on Amazon looking for a replacement.  Usually, I don't believe the ratings or hype, but I decided to give these a try because I really can't live without wireless earbuds.  This is a real rating so listen carefully....THESE EARBUDS ARE SIMPLY THE BEST PERIOD!!!  I paired these up with my Samsung phone in seconds, without reading even the quick start guide.  I did glance at the packaging and I noticed that they said WATERPROOF.  Again, I didn't believe it because for sub $50 you don't usually get everything as advertised.  Seeing that Sony, Bose (who I love) and Samsung are selling the same type earbuds with less advertised features for hundreds of dollars more.Well, I decided to wear these in the shower - since I purchased the Amazon extended warranty I figured if anything goes wrong I am covered.

再说一次，我不相信，因为低于50美元，你通常不会得到所有广告。看到索尼、Bose（我爱的人）和三星都在销售同样类型的耳塞，但广告上的功能却少了，价格高出了几百美元。好吧，我决定在淋浴时戴上它，因为我购买了亚马逊的延长保修期，我想如果出了什么问题，我可以享受保修

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,260,5,"Initially I was having trouble getting the earbuds to fit properly; they were sticking out where they should have been more flush with my ear opening…  After a few attempts I finally got them in right, (see bottom row of image) but it was a challenge at first; helped to stand in front of a mirror. Once you get it right it makes sense and is a snap to fit. It was my first set of Bluetooth earbuds so it was on a steep learning curve to figure it all out at once.Trying all the different sized tips (included) was useful, finally settled on the medium sized ones with good results. I found that learning to put the buds in, in front of a mirror at first was helpful, as was licking the tips for lubrication made the task easier. It takes a simple rotation of the bud to the back that locks the bud in the right position. Once you get it right and see how it fits, it gets easier.The sound is surprisingly very good quality and with good base. If it sounds too thin & tinny initially, it’s a sign that the buds are not properly positioned in the ear.I tried all the included rubber-tip fittings and settled in on the medium. The directions are ambiguous at times and I don’t know if something was lost in the translation, but it easy to figure out and they have a very responsive support team. I contacted them and was linked to several pages and videos that were very helpful.I like the product and can now listen to my Kindle books without disturbing others. Connecting with iPhone/iPad was easy. The charging unit is small enough to carry in my pocket and comes with a lanyard so you can hang around your neck. Nice little compact unit.All in all a nice addition to my pile of technology... :)","最初，我很难让耳塞合身；耳塞伸出的地方应该与我的耳朵张开时更齐平……几次尝试后，我终于把它们插对了（见图片的下一行），但一开始这是一个挑战；帮助我站在镜子前。一旦你做对了，这是有意义的，是一个很快适应。这是我第一套蓝牙耳塞，所以要想一下子搞清这一切，需要一个陡峭的学习曲线
尝试所有不同大小的小费（包括）是有用的，最终解决了中型的，并取得了良好的效果。我发现，一开始在镜子前学会把花蕾放进去是很有帮助的，因为舔一下花蕾的润滑油可以使任务更容易。它需要一个简单的旋转芽到后面，锁定芽在正确的位置。一旦你把它弄对了，看看它如何适合，它就变得容易多了。声音的质量出奇的好，基础也很好
如果一开始听起来太薄，太刺耳，那说明耳塞在耳朵里的位置不对。我试了所有附带的橡胶头配件，然后放在中间。方向有时模棱两可，我不知道翻译过程中是否丢失了什么，但很容易弄清楚，他们有一个反应灵敏的支持团队。我联系了他们，并链接到了一些非常有用的页面和视频
我喜欢这个产品，现在可以在不打扰别人的情况下听我的Kindle书了。连接iPhone/iPad很容易。充电装置很小，可以放在我的口袋里，还配有一根绳子，这样你就可以挂在脖子上了。很好的小型设备。在我那堆技术的基础上又增加了一个。。。:)

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: WHITE,253,5,"First of all, I have spent approx. 2 hrs over the past 2 weeks looking for some wireless earbuds that were reasonably priced, and actually had real reviews.  Each time I would give up out of frustration of all the fraud in the reviews on these products..  For some reason, everytime I though I found a good set up earbuds I would look into approx. 10 reviews to see if the count and star rating was real. some of the other products actually had reviews that were for a completely different product... weird trick.  But consistently I would find a high number of fake reviews.. clearly fake.. note they typically have one review.. OR if they do have multiple reviews you will see they did them all within a couple days for cheap items.  This was the only product with a high review sample size and I couldn't find any evidence in my sampling of fake reviews.  So don't believe me, actually go in and look at a bunch of reviews for this product and see for yourself.  All I would find was reviewers with high review count, many years.. So hard to fake.  I had one other set of earbuds that looked huge, had tinny sound.  SO after my long search and finding these... I am so happy.  I just received them 2 hours ago, so excited had to do a review.  I got the white ones, Sound is excellent, bass is just right, I wouldn't say too much, or too little.. just right.- But yes it does have bass so my songs actually sound like I wanted them to.  Comes with different size earbuds sleeves... I though smaller would be better … but actually found the slightly larger sleeves were best fit, they won't fall out.  Super happy with these, search is over.  One other point is these don't look dorky big in my ears, like the previous ones I tried.  I don't know if noise cancellation is working or not.. hard to tell.. I couldn't hear the TV in the room practically at all so maybe it is working.. OR its just the earbud is blocking my ear canal.. either way sounds great.  Distance is great too, I have walked 50ft away and into my garage.. only there did it start to go choppy, but was going through firedoor and wall.  Plus says there waterproof on box.. I like that for when I exercise..  Great product you will be happy..  I'm glad this seller didn't go dishonest with the reviews like all the other earbuds.  I wish amazon would do sampling of reviews by dishonest dealers and cut them out!, rather them leave me to waste my time figuring it out.7-1-19 One update on my review.  I talked about noise cancellation.  I went and used them for working out.  Found there is really no noise cancellation.  I could still hear the music and noise around when working out, but not bad.. BUT I still love the product.  In fairness I looked again and the manufacturer didn't say there is active noise cancellation, They only mentioned something to the equalivant of noise blocking.. I.E. since there is plugs in your ear canal.  So Still very happy with my purchase.  IF you are looking for active noise cancelling.. these don't have that.  BUT still the Best earbuds I could find on Amazon for a good low price.","首先，在过去的两周里，我花了大约2个小时寻找一些价格合理的无线耳塞，并且得到了真正的评价。每次我都会因为对这些产品的审查中所有的欺诈行为感到沮丧而放弃。。出于某种原因，每次我发现一个好的耳塞，我会查看大约10个评论，看看计数和星级是真的。其他一些产品的评论实际上是针对完全不同的产品。。
诡计。但一直以来，我都会发现大量的虚假评论。。显然是假的。。注意他们通常有一个评论。。或者如果他们有多个评论，你会看到他们在几天内都做了便宜的项目。这是唯一一个审查样本量高的产品，我在假审查的抽样中找不到任何证据。所以不要相信我，实际上进去看看这个产品的一堆评论，然后自己看看
我所能找到的只是那些有着很高评价数的评论者，很多年。。很难伪造。我还有一副耳塞，看起来很大，声音很轻。所以经过我长时间的搜寻和发现。。。我很高兴。我两个小时前才收到，所以兴奋得做了一个回顾。我有白色的，声音很好，低音很好，我不会说太多，或者说太少。。很好。-但是是的，它有低音，所以我的歌听起来像是我想要的
配有不同尺寸的耳塞套。。。我觉得小一点会更好…但实际上发现稍微大一点的袖子最合适，不会掉出来。很高兴看到这些，搜索结束了。另一点是，这些在我的耳朵里看起来并不像以前那样大。我不知道噪音消除是否有效。。很难说。。我几乎听不到房间里的电视，所以也许它在工作。。或者只是耳塞堵住了我的耳道。
不管怎样听起来都不错。距离也太远了，我已经走了50英尺，进了我的车库。。只有在那里，它开始变得波涛汹涌，但正在通过防火门和墙壁。加上盒子上有防水的。。我喜欢当我锻炼的时候。。很好的产品你会很高兴的。。我很高兴这个卖家没有像其他所有的耳塞一样对评论不诚实
我希望亚马逊能对不诚实的经销商的评论进行抽样，并将其剔除！相反，他们让我浪费时间去搞清楚。7-1-19我的评论有一个更新。我说了噪音消除。我去用它们锻炼身体。发现真的没有噪音消除。我在锻炼时仍然能听到周围的音乐和噪音，但还不错。。但我还是喜欢这个产品
公平地说，我又看了一遍，制造商没有说有主动消音，他们只是提到了一些与消音相同的东西。。一、 因为你的耳道里有耳塞。所以对我的购买还是很满意的。如果你正在寻找主动噪声抵消。。这些没有。但我还是能在亚马逊上找到最好的耳塞，而且价格便宜。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,249,5,"I purchased these to listen to music or audio books on my walking commutes. They have never died on me, and my walk is 80 minutes - which is more than I can say for the last BT earbuds I had. I like the earbud receptacle/battery charger case. I not really impressed with the noise cancellation, but that's not a big deal for me (I've read that NC is primarily designed to cancel jet engine noise, and doesn't handle a wide variety of random frequencies well - what I experience walking home with traffic). These also stay in my ear better than the last set I had, which would fall out when I ran (it not fun trying to find the little buggers). They sound fine to me, but I'm not an audiophile and have some high frequency hearing, so I'm not a good judge of audio quality. I would purchase these again.","我买这些是为了在步行途中听音乐或听有声读物。他们从未在我身上死去，我的步行时间是80分钟――这比我最后一次戴上BT耳塞的时间还长。我喜欢耳塞插座/电池充电器
我对噪音消除并没有太大的印象，但这对我来说并不是什么大不了的（我读到NC主要是为了消除喷气发动机的噪音，并且不能很好地处理各种各样的随机频率――我在交通拥挤的情况下步行回家的体验）。这些也比我上次的那套更好地留在我的耳朵里，那套在我跑的时候会掉出来（找那些小虫子可不好玩）

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,252,5,"FINAL UPDATE (#2):  I am updating this review after getting to examine a 3rd pair of earbuds and finding that they were completely trouble free.  I have kept all previous reviews below for completeness sake.  Quick version:  I got a bad pair, but I was quickly sent a replacement, and have used a 3rd pair.  The 2nd and 3rd pair worked flawlessly (the first pair were clearly not the “normal” quality) so I feel compelled to update my review based on this.  I also discovered that if you have a wireless charger (like one you use with your phone), you can rest the charging case on that wireless charging pad and they charge!  That’s so convenient.  I am also finding them to be very comfortable and I enjoy the sound.  Great for the gym!UPDATE 1:  TOZO contacted me by email and sent me a new pair of earbuds.  These earbuds indeed work fine and don't have any issues at all.  I think TOZO understands the importance of reviews and very much wants people to give them good reviews.  I would say they are even a bit aggressive about their customer service. They were always incredibly polite and professional, but they wanted to be sure I got the second pair to try.  I can appreciate their hard work in trying to make sure that I walked away with good things to say about the product.  I have now given this 4 stars because the final product works great, but the fact that I got one that seems to be way too susceptible to interference won't allow me to give it 5 stars in good conscience.Bottom line:- first product worked well except for drops - but they were so frequent in certain places it was maddening- second product worked like a charm and does not seem to have any of the dropping issues- they want to be sure you are happy so the customer service was lightning fast and with no questions asked- If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive pair of Bluetooth wireless earbuds, give these a try.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  They pair easily, have a nice charging case, and seem to have a good battery life.  Unfortunately, they drop signal 3-4xs per minute.  I did a bit of troubleshooting to make sure it was the earbuds and not the device.  I paired it with several devices and the earbuds always dropped signal.  I then paired all of the devices with several other bluetooth headphones and speakers I have (including an Echo).  All of the devices played flawlessly through all of the speakers without dropping signal.  However, these drop regularly.  Sometimes it will go for a minute or two without dropping, sometimes certain places seem to make it worse, but, overall, it happens several times per minute.  It makes an otherwise decent pair of earbuds unusable.  I will return these.","最后更新（#2）：我在检查了第三对耳塞并发现它们完全没有问题之后更新了这篇评论。为了完整起见，我保留了之前所有的评论。快速版本：我得到了一个坏的对，但我很快被派了一个替代品，并使用了第三对。第二对和第三对完美无瑕（第一对显然不是“正常”的质量），所以我觉得有必要在此基础上更新我的评论
我还发现，如果你有一个无线充电器（像一个你用你的手机），你可以把充电箱放在那个无线充电垫上，他们充电！太方便了。我也发现他们非常舒适，我喜欢的声音。很适合健身房！更新1:TOZO通过电子邮件联系我，给我发了一副新耳塞。这些耳塞确实工作良好，没有任何问题
我认为TOZO理解评论的重要性，非常希望人们给他们好的评论。我想说的是，他们在客户服务方面甚至有点咄咄逼人。他们总是非常礼貌和专业，但他们想确保我有第二双试试。我很感激他们的辛勤工作，努力确保我带着对产品的好话离开
我现在给这4颗星是因为最终的产品效果很好，但事实上，我得到的一个似乎太容易受到干扰，这不允许我凭良心给它5颗星
一句话：-第一个产品除了滴水以外都很好-但是在某些地方它们太频繁了以至于让人抓狂了-第二个产品就像一个符咒，而且似乎没有任何滴水的问题-他们想确保你很高兴，所以客户服务速度很快，没有任何问题被问到-如果你正在寻找相对便宜的蓝牙无线耳机，试试
原版评论：他们很容易配对，有一个很好的充电箱，似乎有一个很好的电池寿命。不幸的是，信号每分钟下降3-4倍。我做了一些故障排除，以确保是耳塞而不是设备。我把它和几个设备配对，耳塞总是发出信号。然后我将所有设备与其他蓝牙耳机和扬声器配对（包括回声）
所有的设备在所有的扬声器中完美地播放，没有信号丢失。然而，这些下降是有规律的。有时它会持续一两分钟而没有下降，有时某些地方似乎使情况更糟，但总的来说，它每分钟发生几次。这使得一对原本体面的耳塞无法使用。我会还给你的。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,278,5,"I'll be completely honest: I did not expect anything amazing from these earbuds. In fact, I was entirely prepared to receive them, use them for a day, and send them back due to poor quality.I was happily mistaken.The Pros: Right out of the box, these earbuds looked impressive. The housings on each earpiece have a matte, somewhat tacky (in terms of texture), black finish that feels really nice. Each earbud feels light yet sturdy. There are 4 included rubber earpieces included (the medium size is attached by default). The earbuds pair automatically when taken out of the housing. The sound on these is incredible! When situated properly in the ear, these things pump out a decent layer of bass and produce a surprising clear range of mids and highs! The buds pair automatically when removed from the case, and I have yet to experience any static while listening. They also have an excellent range, and you can even keep them on while you take a shower/bath! The most satisfying part of this purchase was the $31 price tag. I'm struggling to include all of the positive aspects of these earbuds in one review!The Cons: I'm not sure I can think of any at the moment! My only gripe would be that the earbuds don't remain completely in the ear when you start to move around, particularly while running/dancing. When this happens, the sound quality is noticeably reduced (since they start to fall out).Pictured are the XL, L and S earpieces (in that order) as well as all included accessories. The M earpieces are attached to the earbuds.*Note: I have yet to really test the limits of the battery life on these. I will update my review at a later date.","我会说实话：我没想到这些耳塞会有什么惊人的效果。事实上，我完全准备好了接收它们，使用一天，然后由于质量差而将它们寄回去。我很高兴弄错了。优点：这些耳塞在开箱即用的时候看起来令人印象深刻。每个听筒的外壳都有一个哑光，有点俗气（就质地而言），黑色的表面，感觉真的很好。每个耳塞感觉轻而结实
包括4个橡胶听筒（默认情况下为中等尺寸）。耳塞从外罩中取出时会自动配对。上面的声音真不可思议！当正确地放置在耳朵，这些东西泵出一个体面的低音层，并产生一个令人惊讶的中高音清晰范围！当从箱子里取出时，芽会自动配对，而我在听的时候还没有经历过任何静电
它们的射程也很好，你甚至可以在洗澡的时候一直戴着！这次购买最令人满意的部分是31美元的标价。我正在努力把这些耳塞的所有积极方面都包括在一篇评论中！缺点：我不确定我现在能想到什么！我唯一的抱怨是，当你开始走动时，尤其是在跑步/跳舞时，耳塞不会完全留在耳朵里
当这种情况发生时，音质明显降低（因为它们开始脱落）。图中是XL、L和S耳机（按顺序排列）以及所有附带的配件。M耳机与耳塞相连。*注意：我还没有真正测试这些耳机的电池寿命限制。我稍后会更新我的评论。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,248,5,"I've been using ""wireless"" earbuds for the last few years, and although they're more convenient than wired ones the fact that they still are connected to each other with a wire pretty much still makes them a bit ""in the way."" I loved the idea of the AirPods being truly wireless and having a secure storage case that charges the earbuds but I didn't like the design of the earbuds themselves or the shape Apple uses as I prefer in-ear ones. Paired with a high price tag and average sound quality I looked on here to see what true wireless earbuds were available and the Tozo T10s stood out the most. They have the in-ear style earbud, compact charging case, and are very affordable. There are many different wireless earbuds to choose from but I really like the small design of the earbuds themselves, not too long, and don't come with any wing tips that take a bit longer to line up in your ear. Also the charging case is the perfect size, not being too tall or wide, and unlike the majority of other charging cases it can be charged wirelessly and is IPX8 waterproof. The sound quality of the earbuds is very good for my needs of connecting them to my Apple TV and iPad to watch TV shows, YouTube, and music. They usually last between 3-4 hours of listening out of the case which is great and when you do put them back in the case they charge back up very quickly and you can get several recharges out of the carrying case itself before it needs recharged, which also is very fast to charge up. The best method to have the earbuds pair to each other quickly and then to your device is to remove the Right one first, and very quickly (half a second after) remove the Left. That way the right starts searching and as soon as the left one comes on it picks it up and then immediately pairs to whatever device you're using. The only two things I don't like is since the right bud pairs to the left it counts as a connected device and then you can only connect to one other device (for example an iPhone.) It seems even bluetooth 5.0 still can only connect to 2 devices at the same time but since the left earbud counts as a connected device that really only leaves you one. So if they're paired to my Apple TV (which never shuts off) then if I want to connect them to my iPad they'll auto connect to the Apple TV if they were last used on it so I have to manually disconnect them and then they'll pair to the iPad. The buds both have a clickable button but it only does Play/Pause or answers a call, and if you long press it redials the last number you called. I rarely make calls on my iPhone and even if I do I'm not going to use the earbuds with it, I only use them for music and video, so I would prefer that the button functioned as media controls. One button can control several playback features (for example, I press is play/pause, 2 presses is skip forward, and 3 presses is skip back, and since both earbuds have a button one long press on the right could be volume up and one long press on the left is volume down.) Although it's not a big deal, I think those features could make these earbuds truly perfect and hopefully they can release a newer model with those features as I'd gladly buy another pair.","在过去的几年里，我一直在使用“无线”耳塞，虽然它们比有线耳塞更方便，但事实上它们仍然通过一根电线连接在一起，这仍然让它们有点“碍事”。我喜欢AirPods是真正无线的想法，并且有一个安全的存储盒来为耳塞充电，但我没有就像耳塞本身的设计或者苹果在我喜欢的耳朵上使用的形状
再加上高昂的价格和平均的音质，我在这里看到了什么真正的无线耳塞是可用的，而Tozo T10最为突出。他们有入耳式耳塞，紧凑的充电箱，非常实惠。有很多不同的无线耳塞可供选择，但我真的很喜欢耳塞本身的小设计，不要太长，也不要带任何翼尖，在你的耳朵里排成一行需要更长时间
此外，充电箱是完美的尺寸，不是太高或太宽，不像大多数其他充电箱，它可以无线充电，是IPX8防水。耳塞的音质非常适合我将耳塞连接到苹果电视和iPad上观看电视节目、YouTube和音乐的需要
它们通常会持续3-4个小时的监听，这是很好的，当你把它们放回手机壳时，它们会很快充电，你可以在手机壳需要充电之前从手机壳中获得几次充电，充电也很快。最好的方法是先把右边的耳塞取下，然后再把左边的耳塞取下
这样，右边开始搜索，左边一出现，它就拿起它，然后立即配对到你正在使用的任何设备。我唯一不喜欢的两件事是，因为右边的耳机对到左边，它算是一个连接的设备，然后你只能连接到另一个设备（例如iPhone）。看起来即使是蓝牙5.0也只能同时连接到两个设备，但因为左边的耳机算是一个连接的设备，实际上只留给你一个
因此，如果它们与我的苹果电视配对（苹果电视从不关机），那么如果我想将它们连接到我的iPad，它们将自动连接到苹果电视（如果它们上次在iPad上使用），因此我必须手动断开它们的连接，然后它们将配对到iPad。两个按键都有一个可点击的按钮，但它只能播放/暂停或接听来电，如果长按它，则会重拨上次拨打的号码
我很少在iPhone上打电话，即使打了，我也不会把耳机和它一起用，我只把它们用在音乐和视频上，所以我更希望按钮能起到媒体控制的作用。一个按钮可以控制多个播放功能（例如，我按下是播放/暂停，两次按下是向前跳，三次按下是向后跳，因为两个耳塞都有一个按钮，一个长按在右边可以增大音量，一个长按在左边可以减小音量
)虽然这不是什么大不了的事，但我认为这些功能可以使这些耳塞真正完美，希望它们能发布一款具有这些功能的新机型，因为我很乐意再购买一副。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,245,5,"I've had these for about 6 months now and I love these.No more annoying wires dangling around my neck.  And no wires needed to charge this.  The case itself charges wirelessly, and the earbuds charge in the case.  This means I don't have to worry about finding a charger that fits.  No need for lightning connector, USB C, Micro USB, etc.  This charges on any wireless base there is.The sound is great too.  I admit I was worried when buying these because of the lack of wires - but the sound is better than my last pair of wired earbuds.  Definitely better than the sound from Airpods - too much noise is lost with airpods because they don't fit to the ear like earbuds do.These can get loud too, if you want that. - I never turn them up all of the way because it can get too loud for me - and I like loud music - so they get loud enough.Sound quality is great for the types of music I listen to - that includes rap, some pop, classic rock, metal like Metallica and Megadeth, harder metal like Slayer and Lamb of God.  It all sounds great.  I have Bose speakers in my car and the music with these earbuds sounds better than when I listen to the speakers in my car.Customer service is awesome too.  Fast responding and proactive customer service team.","我已经吃了6个月了，我很喜欢这些。再也没有烦人的电线挂在我脖子上了。不需要电线来充电。这个箱子本身是无线充电的，而耳塞是在箱子里充电的。这意味着我不必担心找到合适的充电器。不需要lightning连接器、USB C、Micro USB等。任何无线底座都可以充电。声音也很棒
我承认我买这些耳塞的时候很担心，因为没有电线，但是声音比我最后一副耳塞好。绝对比Airpods的声音好-Airpods失去了太多的噪音，因为它们不像耳塞那样适合耳朵。如果你想的话，这些声音也会变得很大。-我从来没有把它们一路调大，因为它对我来说太吵了――我喜欢大声的音乐――所以它们变得足够吵
音质非常适合我所听的音乐类型，包括说唱，一些流行音乐，古典摇滚，金属般的Metallica和Megadeth，硬金属般的Slayer和Lamb of God。听起来不错。我的车里有Bose扬声器，带耳塞的音乐听起来比我在车里听扬声器时好，客户服务也很棒。快速反应和积极主动的客户服务团队。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,244,5,"UPDATE #2:If you're having problems with your left earbud audio being interrupted, contact their technical support and let them know!I requested support for my left earbud interruption problems, and they happily sent me replacement. I've been trying the replacement for several hours a day for the past couple of days, and several recharges during that time, and I will have to say the problems with the left earbud momentarily losing signal from the right earbud have practically vanished! Now, I'm really happy to have such awesome sound, uninterrupted. Back to 5 star rating. I still get some rare interruptions when working with my arms over my head and in tight, enclosed spaces. But that is probably to be expected for the nature of any true wireless earbuds?I liked that their technical support was eager to help me with my earbud problems. Once they verified my purchase, it wasn't long before I had a free warranty replacement in hand that worked great! How refreshing! :-)Some other additions to my review are:These earbuds come with 4 sizes of removable earpieces to fit different sized ears. There's 2 sets consecutively larger than the size installed from the factory, and 1 size smaller. The one from the factory fits my ears just fine, but was a little too small, and I could tell because I could still hear additional noises around me. To replace the ""tips"", I recommend gripping the earbud firmly with one hand, and the removable ear piece/tip with the fingers of the other hand, squeezing the tip gently, but firmly, and twisting back and forth a little while pulling away. (Reverse that for putting on the new tips, being careful to get the removable cap lined up properly with the tube). For me, the next size up still fit comfortably, and blocked out most of the surrounding sounds. This was my ideal fit. The sizes were close together, and difficult to tell next size up (or down) until I laid them all out side by side for comparison. The largest size has a black ""center"" (instead of red like the others).Another observation to record is that I think I noticed that the earbuds wont charge until you take the case (battery pack) off of being charged / its charger? Someone feel free to crrect me if I am wrong. But on mine, I would charge the base up (amount of charge indicated nice by four blue charging leds), then when I removed it from the charger, the earbud indicator lights would turn red indicating that they were charging. when everything is charged, all the lights turn off. I found I could get them all turn turn back on (to see the charge level of the case and make sure the earbuds were charged) simply by lifting the earbuds a little and letting magnetism pull them right back down to the charger.It seems like the case does not hold its charge after a couple of weeks? I could be wrong about that as I may not have charged it after draining it the last time?UPDATE #1: After some heavy use of these earbuds, I had to come back and lower my rating (from 4 to 3) on these earbuds. They are great earbuds, but the reason for my lowering this rating is because of the number of times the left earbud loses connection from the right earbud. The music in left earbud stops play and then usually comes back shortly afterwards. even when I am sitting typing at my computer (low activity). It definitely happens more often when I'm working / doing activity while using the earbuds (high activity). This happens even when the earbuds are fully charged. I have also reset the earbuds according to the manual (purple flashes). And that has not helped any. I'll inquire with their technical support as well.ORIGINAL REVIEW:(Please note disclaimers at the bottom of this review).This is my first true wireless earbuds, and I like them a lot!I bought this because I wanted to listen to music in my basement while moving around a lot and not have to play the music loud and disrupt my wife upstairs. I felt this product had good reviews and was a reasonable price to introduce me to the bluetooth true wireless earbuds.PROs:Nice packagingThe manual was good / decent enough for me to be able to understand and use most of the functionality of the device(s). Furthermore, I found that the device(s) behaved as the manual indicated they would. They readily advertise their support contact information throughout.Device(s) came with a partial charge so I could start using it right away if I wanted. However, I usually charge them fully first.I did have to change the earpieces to fit my ears better. I'm glad it comes with 4 different sized earpieces. The instructions did not specify how to change the earpieces. I didn't want to break them and could not tell for a while if they pulled on/off or screwed on/off. (They pull on/off).Devices were easy to hook up and get to operate. I did not have any problems pairing with my computer. I have NOT tried pairing with other devices.I felt like the bluetooth range was reasonable. I dont have much (other bluetooth devices) to compare it with, though. The more centrally located in the house the bluetooth source (my computer) was, the more range I could get throughout the house / basement. And of course anything getting in between you and the source diminishes or interrupts available signal strength, especially metals.I really liked the sound quality of these earbuds, and I felt like they did a good job of sealing out surrounding noises. They do not actively cancel any noise around you, though. I was happy with the sound quality. I'm also not an audiophile. I felt like the trebles were crispy, and the bass boomy. It does not come with an EQ, so you have to use your own EQ if you want to customize your listening experience to your preferences.They come with a built-in microphone, but I also did not test that feature. This was important feature to me though, in case i wanted to do conference calling or other calling in the future.the earbuds have a ""button"" on each one. The instruction manual contains details about their use.I did not test the water-proofness of these earbuds.I feel like the battery life was accurate: I think mfr specified about 4 hours of battery life for the earbuds before you had to recharge them(?). I got about this and maybe a little more.The earbuds seemed to be very (acceptably) light for their functionality / lifespan. But again I have no frame of reference.The charging lights are all inside the carrying/charging case. you can see the lights through the top of the case (kind of a smokey tint to the case. You can have the lid open to see the lights better, or closed and still see the charge status. It seems like you can charge the case or charge the earbuds, but not both at the same time(?). Either that or it took a lot longer to do both at the same time. It did not take too long to charge the case from completely drained (couple hours?), and about an hour or a little more to charge the earbuds from dead.The earbuds have built in voice that can guide you occasionally, like when battery is low, etc.P.S. wireless charging is pretty cool! No wires to regularly plug and unplug once the charging unit is set up. Just lay down your device to charge it and pick it up when needed.CONs:One thing that was kind of annoying was disconnects / losing connection (interrupting the music). The left earbud pairs with the right earbud, and they have to have good communication with each other on either side of your head. Sometimes, when getting too close to a monitor, other electronics, other rf noise sources (like cfl lights), or even just putting my hand/arm up to rest my chin on it while sitting in front of my computer would cause a disconnect between left and right earbuds until I removed the interference to a greater distance. rarely it would lose connection for apparently no reason at all. But the other times, the difficulties were obvious, and simply avoiding those interferences would quickly bring back the music. This is the reason I had to give the product 4 stars. I would be willing to live with the occasional disconnect and give it 5 stars, but the disconnects were enough to annoy me at times and thus 4 stars. In all cases (except going out of range and being disconnected for too long causing a timeout), the earbuds would continue automatically once interference removed.When signal would be interrupted, though, the earbuds would very kindly fade the music (audio). There was no popping, crackling, blowing out your eardrum, etc noises.Among the manual / instructions was an insert called ""wearing steps"" that I felt was difficult to understand. But I figured it out eventually.DISCLAIMERS:disclaimer1: Manufacturer is offering a free wireless charging pad in exchange for a review. I dont usually submit product reviews because everyone else does such a good job, but a free wireless charging pad to use with the earbuds would be nice. I endeavor to be truthful and not let this sway my review.disclaimer2: This is my first true wireless bluetooth earbuds. I'm just getting into the bluetooth scene, and so dont have a lot of bluetooth product experience to draw from, but I am an electronics geek, and do have some related electronic and PC computer experience and history.","更新#2：如果您的左耳塞音频被中断，请联系他们的技术支持并让他们知道！我请求支持我的左耳塞中断问题，他们很高兴地给我换了一个
在过去的几天里，我每天都试着更换耳塞好几个小时，在这段时间里，我不得不说，左耳塞暂时失去右耳塞信号的问题实际上已经消失了！现在，我真的很高兴有这么棒的声音，不间断。回到五星级。当我双手抱着头在狭小的空间里工作时，我仍然会受到一些罕见的干扰
但这可能是任何真正的无线耳塞的性质所期望的吗？我喜欢他们的技术支持急于帮助我解决耳塞问题。一旦他们核实了我的购买，不久我就有了一个免费的保修更换在手，工作很好！多爽啊！：-）我的评论中还增加了一些内容：这些耳塞配有4种尺寸的可拆卸耳机，以适应不同尺寸的耳朵
有两套比工厂安装的尺寸大，一套小。从工厂来的那个正好适合我的耳朵，但有点太小了，我能分辨出来，因为我还能听到周围的其他噪音。要更换“耳塞”，我建议用一只手紧紧地握住耳塞，用另一只手的手指紧紧地握住可拆卸的耳塞/耳尖，轻轻但用力地挤压耳塞，并在拔出的同时来回扭动一点
（装上新的针头时，请将其颠倒过来，小心将可拆卸的盖子与管子正确对齐）。对我来说，下一个尺寸的仍然很合适，并且挡住了周围的大部分声音。这是我的理想选择。这些尺寸很接近，在我把它们并排放在一起比较之前，很难分辨下一个尺寸。最大的有一个黑色的“中心”（而不是像其他的红色）
另一个需要记录的观察是，我想我注意到耳塞不会充电，直到你把手机壳（电池组）从充电状态/充电器上取下来？如果我错了，有人可以批评我。但在我的手机上，我会给底座充电（4个蓝色充电LED指示灯显示充电量很好），然后当我从充电器上取下它时，耳塞指示灯就会变成红色，表示正在充电。当一切都充满电时，所有的灯都熄灭了
我发现只要稍微抬起耳塞，让磁力把它们拉回到充电器上，就可以让它们都重新打开（查看手机壳的充电水平，确保耳塞已充电）
几周后，这个案子似乎就不成立了？我可能是错的，因为我可能没有充电后，排水它最后一次？更新1：在大量使用这些耳塞后，我不得不回来降低我对这些耳塞的评分（从4降到3）。它们是很好的耳塞，但是我降低这个等级的原因是因为左耳塞和右耳塞失去联系的次数
左耳塞的音乐停止播放，然后通常很快就会回来。即使我坐在电脑前打字（低活动）。当我使用耳塞（高活性）工作/活动时，这种情况肯定会更频繁。即使耳塞充满电，这种情况也会发生。我还根据说明书重新设置了耳塞（紫色闪光）。但这并没有起到任何作用。我也会询问他们的技术支持
原版评论：（请注意评论底部的免责声明）。这是我第一个真正的无线耳塞，我非常喜欢它们！我买这个是因为我想在地下室边走边听音乐，不必大声播放音乐，也不想打扰楼上的妻子。我觉得这个产品有很好的评价，是一个合理的价格向我介绍蓝牙真正的无线耳塞
优点：包装很好，这本手册很好/很体面，我能够理解和使用设备的大部分功能。此外，我发现设备的性能与手册中所示的一样。他们随时公布他们的支持联系信息。设备附带部分费用，这样我可以立即开始使用，如果我想的话。不过，我通常都是先充好电。我的确得换个耳机，才能更合耳
我很高兴它配有4个不同尺寸的耳机。说明书没有具体说明如何更换耳机。我不想把它们弄坏，一时也说不清它们是开还是关。（他们开/关）设备很容易连接和操作。我和我的电脑配对没有任何问题。我没有试过与其他设备配对。我觉得蓝牙范围是合理的。不过，我没有太多（其他蓝牙设备）可以与之相比
蓝牙源（我的电脑）越集中在房子里，我可以在整个房子/地下室得到的范围就越大。当然，你和信号源之间的任何干扰都会减弱或中断可用的信号强度，尤其是金属。我真的很喜欢这些耳塞的音质，我觉得它们很好地屏蔽了周围的噪音。不过，它们不会主动消除你周围的噪音。我对音质很满意
我也不喜欢听音乐。我觉得高音很脆，低音很响。它没有EQ，所以如果你想根据自己的喜好定制你的收听体验，你必须使用你自己的EQ，它们带有内置麦克风，但我也没有测试这个功能。不过，这对我来说很重要，以防将来我想打电话给别人
说明书上有详细的使用说明，我没有测试这些耳塞的防水性，我觉得电池续航时间是准确的：我想mfr规定了耳塞的电池续航时间约为4小时，然后你才需要给它们充电。我了解了这个，也许更多一些。耳塞的功能/寿命似乎非常轻（可以接受）。但我又没有参照系。充电灯都在手提箱里
你可以透过箱子的顶部看到灯光（有点像烟熏的颜色）。你可以打开盖子看灯更好，或关闭，仍然看到充电状态。看起来你可以给箱子充电或者给耳塞充电，但不能同时给两者充电。不是这样，就是同时做这两件事花了很长时间。没过多久，这个箱子就被完全排干了（几个小时？），大约一个小时或更长一点来充电耳塞
耳塞有内置的声音，可以引导你偶尔，如当电池电量低，等。P.S.无线充电是相当酷！充电装置安装好后，不要定期插拔电线。把你的设备放下充电，需要的时候再拿起。缺点：有一件事很烦人，就是断开/断开连接（中断音乐）
左耳塞和右耳塞配对，它们必须在你的头的两边有良好的沟通。有时，当我离显示器、其他电子设备、其他射频噪声源（如cfl灯）太近，甚至只是坐在电脑前用手/手臂托着下巴时，都会导致左右耳塞断开，直到我将干扰消除到更远的距离
它很少会毫无理由地失去联系。但其他时候，困难是显而易见的，只要避免这些干扰，就会很快把音乐带回来。这就是为什么我要给产品4星。我愿意偶尔和它断绝关系，给它5颗星，但断绝关系有时足以使我恼火，因此4颗星
在任何情况下（除了超出范围并断开连接太长时间导致超时外），一旦干扰消除，耳塞将自动继续工作。但当信号中断时，耳塞会非常友好地使音乐（音频）褪色。没有爆裂声、噼啪声、鼓膜爆裂声等。说明书/说明书中有一个我觉得很难理解的插入语，叫做“穿着步骤”。但我最终发现了
免责声明：免责声明1：制造商提供免费无线充电板，以换取审查。我通常不提交产品评论，因为其他人都做得很好，但一个免费的无线充电垫与耳塞一起使用会很好。我努力做到诚实，不让这影响我的评论。免责声明2：这是我第一个真正的无线蓝牙耳机

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,244,5,"I'd give these ""TOZO T10"" earbuds 4.7 stars if I could.(I didn't get paid for this review, and I didn't get the earbuds for free.)The only major drawback I can see is the audio/video delay (lag) that I get on my laptop.I originally bought these in an attempt to find bluetooth earbuds that didn't stick way out of my ear, had decent bass response, and most importantly, didn't have the infamous audio/video lag when watching on my laptop.The good:-Comfortable in my ear-Sound is great (TONS OF BASS)-Battery pack and ability to charge the earbuds is niceThe ""needs improvement"" section:-The audio/video delay (lag) is still there!-Stcks out of my ear a bit, but not too badOverall, the earbuds are really nice! I am searching for another pair though, due to the audio/video delay (lag).I tested the audio/video lag by watching videos on YouTube and videos on my laptop. I have a Bluetooth 5.0 card in my laptop, so I don't think that's it, but I could be wrong.I also tested the music/bass response with the following songs:-Eye of the Tiger (Survivor)-Danger Zone (Kenny Loggins)-YMCA (Village People)The bass is really amazing, so I'm keeping these as my ""control"" set. I compared these to the ""Audio Shockerz"" pair that I just bought, and the sound stage and the bass in the ""TOZO"" is quite a bit better, so I'm returning the ""Audio Shockerz"".If the audio/video lag wasn't here, I'd say these earbuds would be nearly perfect. And waterproof to boot!","如果可以的话，我会给这些“TOZO T10”耳塞4.7颗星（我没有得到这篇评论的报酬，我也没有免费得到耳塞）我能看到的唯一的主要缺点是我在笔记本电脑上得到的音频/视频延迟（延迟）。我最初买这些耳塞是为了找到蓝牙耳塞，它不会卡在我耳朵外面，有不错的低音响应，最重要的是，在我的笔记本电脑上观看时没有声名狼藉的音频/视频延迟
好的：-在我的耳朵里的舒适声音是伟大的（吨低音）-电池组和充电耳塞的能力是美好的“需要改进”部分：-音频/视频延迟（滞后）仍然存在！-我耳朵有点不舒服，但总的来说不算太差，耳塞真的很好！不过，由于音频/视频延迟（lag），我正在寻找另一对。我通过在YouTube上观看视频和在笔记本电脑上观看视频来测试音频/视频延迟。我有蓝牙5
我的笔记本电脑里有一张0卡，所以我不认为是这样，但我可能错了。我还用以下歌曲测试了音乐/低音的响应：―虎眼（幸存者）―危险区（肯尼・洛金斯）―基督教青年会（乡村人）－低音真的很棒，所以我把这些作为我的“控制”设置。我把这些和我刚买的“音频冲击波”对比较了一下，“TOZO”中的音阶和低音都好多了，所以我要把“音频冲击波”还给你
如果音频/视频延迟不在这里，我会说这些耳塞几乎是完美的。防水靴！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,246,5,"I bought these based on the reviews. The reviews were awesome. But, I really felt like the reviews were too good to be true. So I figured for $30 what would I really be losing if they didn't work out. I have say the positive reviews are right on the money. These earbuds come with several sets of earpieces to ensure you get the proper fit. They are small and discrete and tuck nicely into the ear and they stay in while running and working out and sweating. I use them not only to listen to music and watch Netflix on my phone but also for hands free talking in my car and they work great.  The charging carrier has a built in charger bank that keeps the earbuds charged after being unplugged from a power source.  I bought mine on a Prime lightning deal and got them even cheaper than the regular price. Talk about a bargain. So they get 5 stars. A definite buy for anyone looking for awesome, wireless earbuds on the cheap. I have had mine since Christmas and they are working great.","我是根据评论买的。评论真是太棒了。但是，我真的觉得这些评论太好了，不可能是真的。所以我花了30美元想，如果他们不解决的话，我到底会失去什么。我说过积极的评价是正确的。这些耳塞配有几套耳机，以确保您得到适当的适合。它们小而分散，能很好地塞进耳朵里，在跑步、锻炼和出汗的时候都能呆在里面
我用它们不仅可以听音乐，用手机看Netflix，还可以在车里进行免提通话，效果非常好。充电载体有一个内置的充电器组，可以在从电源上拔下后保持耳塞充电。我是以闪电优惠价买的，而且比正常价格还便宜。谈谈便宜货。所以他们得到了5颗星。一个明确的购买任何人寻找可怕的，无线耳塞便宜
我从圣诞节起就有了我的，他们工作得很好。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,248,5,"While this doesn't touch the $300+ Jabras for sound quality and range, these are really amazing. The range is just as advertised, though when you approach the 30 ft mark, it cuts out. Occasionally, I find that if the phone is in my back pocket, this also can cause cut out. At the cost of a low end product, these headphones have high mid-tier worth. The bass is clear, it takes serious bass to distort them. They can sound a little tinny at times if the input is mostly treble. I've dropped them so many times and never experienced any issues. I also wear them in the shower from time to time and they are still going strong.UPDATE: Just a few short days after posting this review, the case stopped accepting a charge. I contacted TOZO and they've not only sent me a replacement case, but also an extra bonus as well, just for the inconvenience. Highly recommend!","虽然这并没有触及300美元以上的捷普音质和范围，这些真的是惊人的。这个范围就像广告上说的那样，但是当你接近30英尺的高度时，它就消失了。偶尔，我发现如果手机在我的后口袋里，这也会导致断线。以低端产品为代价，这些耳机具有较高的中端价值。低音是清楚的，它需要严重的低音扭曲他们。如果输入的声音大多是三倍的话，它们有时会听起来有点刺耳
我已经放弃了很多次，从来没有经历过任何问题。我也经常在淋浴时戴着它们，而且它们仍然很结实。更新：就在发表这篇评论的几天之后，这个案子就不再接受指控了。我联系了东佐，他们不仅给我寄了一个替换的箱子，还额外给了我一笔奖金，只是为了给我带来不便。强烈推荐！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,242,5,"I have had my earbuds for about 4 months now. I am a highly technical person, and I love music, but do not think I would classify myself as an audiophile. I now have 3 different sets of TWS earbuds, and out of the 3, these are my favorites. One thing I did that makes a difference, at least for me, is I replaced the included tips with memory foam ones that I have used on a number of different earbuds over the past few years.Pros:Good sound qualityGood bass, especially with replacement tipsGood battery lifeRapid chargingWireless case chargingSolid build feelGood customer serviceConsStiff buttonsIntermittent connection lossSound/Bass:These sound as good as any other headphones I have used over the past 5 years or so. I do not spend the money for high-end brands like Bose or Beats, so I can't really compare these to them. I was able to hear a full range of frequencies and there was good clarity. With replacement memory foam tips, the noise isolation is good enough to block out 75% or more of my 20-year old lawnmower's engine.Battery LifeI have researched and used enough of these to realize that I am not going to go 9-20 hours without having to change the buds. That said, even at high volume levels, the battery life on the buds exceeds what I expected. I can get from 2.5-3 hours on full volume, usually, and longer if I am not playing music/audio books the entire time. They charge pretty quickly in the case too, which means minimal downtime if you need to charge them up. I particularly love the wireless charging for the case. At night, I can just drop it on a charging pad next to bed, and well before morning, the case and buds are at full charge. Between the buds and the case, I am able to go all day without having to recharge the case.BuildThe buds and the case have a solid feel to them and have held up well. The case, in particular, is solid and has survived my pants pocket and laptop bag admirably. Another brand that I purchased, the cover broke off the case within 2 months.Customer ServiceI have had to reach out to TOZO twice about my buds. The first time, was due to intermittent loss of connection, the second, when my right earbud died. I received responses in a reasonable amount of time (usually, overnight), and there was no hassle dealing with them.Stiff ButtonsI find the buttons are a bit stiff on the buds, and when I press them, I sometimes feel like I am forcing the bud deeper/too deep into my ear canal. It is not a huge issue, but if you push at the wrong angle, it can be a little uncomfortable.Intermittent ConnectivityThis is probably the only, and biggest, issue I encountered. All TWS buds that I have encountered, and even bluetooth headphones such as the Leophile Eel and LG Tone (any version) can lose connectivity. What I found is that there are a couple of places where the buds regularly get disrupted for some reason. I realize it must be the concentration of wireless/bluetooth signal, but it is inconvenient. It has never reached a point where I felt I needed to go out and buy a different pair to resolve the issue.My other TWS earbuds are the Enacfire E19 and Enacfire E20. As much as I like the E19, these are just enough better for me to move them to the ""backup"" set. I just got the E20, and the shape/size of them is odd enough that I am not sure that I can enjoy them. Compared to either, the TOZO buds win.","我的耳塞已经用了4个月了。我是一个技术性很强的人，我喜欢音乐，但我不认为我会把自己归类为一个音响发烧友。我现在有3套不同的TWS耳塞，其中3套是我的最爱。我所做的一件事，至少对我来说，是我用记忆泡沫耳塞代替了其中的耳塞，这些记忆泡沫耳塞是我在过去几年里用在许多不同的耳塞上的
优点：音质好低音好，特别是更换了tipsGood电池寿命快充电无线手机壳充电结实结实的感觉良好的客户服务舒适的按键连接断开/低音：这些音质和我过去5年左右使用的任何其他耳机一样好。我不把钱花在像Bose或Beats这样的高端品牌上，所以我不能把这些和它们相比。我能听到全范围的频率，而且声音清晰
有了可更换的记忆泡沫头，噪音隔离能力足以挡住我20年前的割草机75%或更多的引擎。我已经研究并使用了足够的电池寿命，意识到如果不更换电池，我将无法坚持9-20小时。也就是说，即使在高容量的情况下，电池的续航时间也超出了我的预期。我可以从2.5-3小时的全音量，通常，如果我不播放音乐/有声书籍的整个时间，更长
在这种情况下，它们的充电速度也很快，这意味着如果你需要充电的话，停机时间最少。我特别喜欢这个箱子的无线充电。晚上，我可以把它放在床边的充电垫上，在早上之前，箱子和花蕾已经充满电了。在花蕾和箱子之间，我可以一整天都不必给箱子充电
特别是，这个箱子很结实，在我的裤子口袋和笔记本电脑包里保存得很好。我买的另一个品牌，封面在两个月内就坏了。我的客户服务部不得不就我的花蕾问题联系两次。第一次，是因为断断续续的失去联系，第二次，我的右耳塞死了。我在一段合理的时间内（通常是一夜之间）收到了回复，处理它们没有任何麻烦
僵硬的钮扣我发现钮扣在耳蕾上有点僵硬，当我按下钮扣时，我有时觉得我把耳蕾压得更深/太深。这不是一个大问题，但如果你往错误的角度推，可能会有点不舒服。间歇性连接这可能是我遇到的唯一、也是最大的问题。我遇到的所有TWS耳机，甚至连Leophile Eel和LG Tone（任何版本）等蓝牙耳机都可能失去连接
我发现有几个地方的花蕾由于某种原因经常被破坏。我知道一定是无线/蓝牙信号的集中，但不方便。它从来没有达到我觉得需要出去买一双不同的耳机来解决这个问题的地步，我的另外两个耳塞是Enacfire E19和Enacfire E20。尽管我很喜欢E19，但这些对我来说还是足够好，可以将它们移到“备份”集
我刚买了E20，它的形状/大小很奇怪，我不确定我是否能喜欢。相比之下，托佐・布雷兹赢了。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,245,5,"EDIT: pleased with customer service! They reached out and offered to send us another complementary set of earbuds. We were pleasantly surprised to receive a new set and they worked perfectly!!!! Yay! Thank you Tozo for going above and beyond to make this right :)――――So I wanted to buy a pair of True Wireless Earbuds for myself and my wife.  I received the initial trial pair to try out since I was skeptical at first.  I unboxed the first set and everything worked great.  Both ear buds worked great from the start.  They paired with one another, when placed in the charging cradle, both earbuds indicated they were taking a charge by lighting up and automatically restarted/reconnected out of the cradle.  The sound out the earbuds were impressive and were a comfortable fit.  I was happy with the purchase.  I went ahead and ordered another pair for my wife.  When I got the second pair, I unpacked the TWE and immediately I noticed the left earbud didn't start up right away and pair with the Right.  I had to turn it on and wait for it to pair.  When I placed the earbuds into the charging cradle, I noticed the left earbud did not indicate it was taking a charge by lighting up and did not restart/repair upon taking it out of the cradle.  Both earbuds seemed to work but I had no way of telling the earbuds were taking a charge.  I did not want to risk the purchase so I asked for a replacement.  Amazon of course made excellent on the replacement and I received my third pair.  Sadly when I opened the third pair, I experienced the same issues after unboxing but this time it was the right ear bud acting up.  Again, if it doesn't work properly out of the box, I am inclined to return it right away.  I took a refund on the third pair and will look for a completely different pair.  The initial pair are working good and am happy with them.  I am just disappointing I could not get a second pair for my wife.  I will have to go shopping again.","编辑：对客户服务满意！他们伸出手来，向我们提供另一套耳塞。我们惊喜地收到了一套新的，他们工作得很好！！！！耶！谢谢Tozo，为了这一点，我做了很多努力：）――所以我想给自己和妻子买一副真正的无线耳塞。我收到了最初的试验对，因为我是怀疑在一开始。我打开了第一盘，一切都很顺利
两个耳塞从一开始就很管用。它们相互配对，当放在充电座上时，两个耳塞都表示它们正在通过点亮来充电，并自动重新启动/重新连接出充电座。耳塞发出的声音令人印象深刻，而且很舒服。我对这次收购很满意。我去给我妻子订了另一双
当我拿到第二双耳塞时，我打开了那双耳塞，我立刻发现左耳塞并没有立刻启动，而是与右耳塞配对。我得打开它等它配对。当我把耳塞放进充电座时，我注意到左耳塞没有通过点亮来指示它正在充电，而且从充电座取出后也没有重新启动/修理。两个耳塞似乎都起作用了，但我没办法告诉他们耳塞在起作用
我不想冒险购买，所以我要求更换。亚马逊当然在更换上做得很好，我收到了我的第三双。可悲的是，当我打开第三对耳塞时，拆线后我也遇到了同样的问题，但这次是右耳塞在起作用。再说一次，如果开箱后不能正常工作，我倾向于立即退货。我退了第三双，会找一双完全不同的
最初的一对工作得很好，很满意。我只是很失望我没能给我妻子买第二双。我得再去购物。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: WHITE,234,5,"This is my first set or truly wireless earbuds, but I made sure to read up on features and see reviews before purchasing.  My biggest hesitation before buying was that I was worried that the sound quality couldn’t possibly be as good as my trusty wired earbuds.  But, after reading many of the reviews on many other types, this one came back with a lot of good comments about sound quality, so I gave in and ordered them in white.Now i have only had these for a day or two, but I am happy to report that the sound quality is actually As-Good as my wired ones, which themselves were great.  Not only that, the bass quality was right on point as well.  Huge plus.Comfort:  I have fairly small ears, and I was worried about them being heavy or not fit properly.  I was also worried about them making my ears sore.  Well, I am happy report that I wore them for several hours last night and for several hours again today - no pain.  They are not nearly as heavy as I was expecting, which was another big plus.  As for the fit, I needed to put the smallest of the silicone earpieces on them, but then they were a good fit.They didn’t fall out as I moved about my kitchen (even danced a bit -lol) and they stayed put.Battery: the left one died a few minutes after unpacking the box, but after charging them, they  lasted about 4 hours before the battery level getting low.  I charged them overnight, and they lasted another 5 hours.  The charging is FAST, though, so you don’t  have to wait hours and hours for them to be ready to go again.  So would I love them to last longer on a charge? Yes probably...but for my lifestyle, 5 hours is plenty.  (Updated note: after owning these for a couple of months, they only last about 3 hours before needing a charge, and the right one doesn’t hold a charge as well as the left one for some reason.  This might just be my pair. We will see over the next few months if they continue to decline...)Phone call use:  I did a test call and I could hear the other person fine, and they could hear me...they just said it was slightly quieter than normal, but still could hear me clearly.The background noise blocking was moderately good.  I think if the fit was really snug it would be better,  but I’d say they were about 80% as good as my noise-cancelling wired earbuds.  But I still have to take them out if someone wants to talk to me, so it blocks plenty of sound out.  And if your fit is better, I’m sure it would be great.Signal:  the packaging says the distance range is about 10 meters.  I tested that and I think I went farther than that without them disconnecting.  Maybe I should measure next time, but no need.  I went far enough to be impressed.Updated note: these little guys don’t like to be separated, though.  If you are only using one in your ear and one on a table or somewhere not in your ear (but turned on), there tends to be an intermittent sputtering of the sound until they are close together again (I.e., both in your ears).  It happens less when they are fully charged,  and if you only want to wear one, just don’t turn on the left one and you’ll be fine.Overall thoughts:  I am very pleased with these.  I love the sound of my music and not getting tangled up in cords, or feel the shock of accidentally ripping one out of my ear because of getting caught in cords.  Bring on my moving-constantly lifestyle - I’m ready to enjoy my wireless life!  Totally worth the price.  Get some.","这是我的第一套或真正的无线耳塞，但我一定要在购买前阅读功能和查看评论。在购买之前，我最大的犹豫是担心音质不可能像我那可靠的有线耳塞那么好。但是，在阅读了许多其他类型的评论之后，这篇文章对音质有了很多好的评价，所以我让步了，并用白色订购了它们
现在我只吃了一两天，但我很高兴地告诉大家，音质其实和我的有线音质一样好，它们本身就很棒。不仅如此，低音质量也恰到好处。很好。安慰：我的耳朵很小，我担心耳朵太重或不合适。我也担心他们会让我耳朵痛。好吧，我很高兴昨晚穿了几个小时，今天又穿了几个小时-没有痛苦
它们没有我预想的那么重，这是另一个很大的好处。至于合身性，我需要把最小的硅胶耳机戴在上面，但之后合身性很好。当我在厨房里走动的时候，耳机并没有掉下来（甚至跳了一小段舞），它们也没掉下来。电池：左边的那个在打开盒子几分钟后就死了，但在充电之后，耳机的续航时间比电池电量高了大约4个小时越来越低。我给他们充电了一夜，他们又坚持了5个小时
不过，充电速度很快，所以你不必等上好几个小时，让他们准备好再次充电。所以我希望他们在一次冲锋中能坚持更长时间吗？可能是的……但对于我的生活方式来说，5个小时就足够了。（更新说明：在拥有了几个月后，它们只持续了大约3个小时，然后才需要充电，而右的一个不持有充电以及左的一个原因。这可能只是我的一对
如果他们继续拒绝，我们将在接下来的几个月里看到……）电话使用：我做了一个测试，我能听到对方的声音，他们能听到我的声音……他们只是说比正常情况稍微安静一些，但仍然能清楚地听到我的声音。背景噪音屏蔽还算好。我想如果合身的话会更好，但我想它们大约是我消除有线耳塞噪音的80%
但如果有人想和我说话，我还是得把它们拿出来，这样就可以屏蔽很多声音。如果你的身材好一点，我肯定会很好的。信号：包装上说距离范围是10米左右。我测试过了，我想我走得更远，没有断开它们。也许下次我应该量一下，但没必要。我做了很多让我印象深刻的事情。最新消息：这些小家伙不喜欢被分开，尽管
如果你只使用一个在耳朵里，一个在桌子上，或者不在耳朵里的某个地方（但是打开了），声音会有间歇性的喷溅，直到它们再次靠近（即两个在你的耳朵里）。当它们充满电的时候，这种情况很少发生，如果你只想穿一件，只要不要打开左边的那件，你就没事了
我喜欢音乐的声音，不会被绳子缠住，也不会因为被绳子缠住而感到不小心从耳朵里扯出来的震动。带上我不断移动的生活方式-我准备好享受我的无线生活！完全值得付出代价。弄点来。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,246,5,"I recommend these airbuds, because they are inexpensive and well worth the price. They are extremely easy to pair, not difficult or too techy to understand how to work them. When I wear them at the gym the outside sounds do not bother me, you can hear the music. I use them when I clean my home, when I vacuum I can't even hear the machine. You can change the size of the rubber bud so you shouldn't have a problem fitting your ears. So far this was worth the cost instead of paying $200 for higher AirPods. Great Job!","我推荐这些气囊，因为它们价格便宜，而且很值钱。它们非常容易配对，不难也不太技术，无法理解如何使用它们。当我在健身房穿着它们时，外面的声音不会打扰我，你可以听到音乐。当我打扫房间的时候，当我吸尘的时候，我甚至听不到机器的声音。你可以改变橡皮芽的大小，这样你就不会有问题适合你的耳朵

They connect seamless to my phone.Each earbud has a button to power it on and off, independently.  There are multiple inserts for different user sizes.  The system includes a charging cable for those without wireless charging, and there is a carrying strap which I find to be useless.Sound quality of talk radio on Sirius/XM Radio and music are excellent.  There is a nice balance of midrange, treble and bass.  The standard sized ear pieces worked perfectly for me, and they're stable in the ears.I may have to do a back up set since I really like these over other headsets/earbuds I have used in the past.Definitely a two thumbs up for me.Update:Speaking indoors is not an issue.

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,240,5,"I am a non-paid reviewer, but was asked to review the product.4.5 stars rounded up.Why 4.5-Stars?- Great sound.  Pretty damn great actually.  Rivals more expensive sets for sure.- Light (for me), and they stay in my ears while I run/sweat.- No issues with disconnection, though sometimes the audio will blip.  I don't know if this is due to poor LTE in some situations or if the headset is struggling to maintain connectivity.  It doesn't happen often.- I haven't dunked myself in water with these on, but its nice to know they won't die due to that.- The charging case is a generic thing that most manufacturers offer for this type of setup now, but this is a nice battery/charging case to boot.Why not complete 5 Stars?- Well, this isn't the manufacturers fault, but I should have looked harder at the specs.  It seems Bluetooth LL (Low Latency, or APTX LL) is not supported.  What that means is that extremely low latency applications (like gaming) utilize the generic Bluetooth protocol only.  This means that there can be a small lag in video to audio sync in SOME applications.  For instance, if you pair to a TV and listen/watch.Overall, very happy.  Great build quality and great follow up by the TOZO team.  They obviously care.","我是一个非付费的评论员，但被要求对产品进行评议。4.5星加起来。为什么是4.5星？-好声音。真是太棒了。当然可以和更贵的电视机竞争。-轻的（对我来说），当我跑步/出汗时它们会留在我的耳朵里。-断开没有问题，尽管有时音频会闪烁。我不知道这是否是由于在某些情况下LTE不好，或者是因为耳机难以保持连接。这种事不常发生
-我还没有把这些衣服泡在水里，但很高兴知道它们不会因此而死。-充电箱是大多数制造商现在为这种类型的装置提供的通用产品，但这是一个很好的启动电池/充电箱。为什么不完成5星？-好吧，这不是制造商的错，但我应该更仔细地看规格。似乎不支持蓝牙LL（低延迟，或APTX LL）
这意味着极低延迟的应用程序（如游戏）只使用通用蓝牙协议。这意味着在某些应用程序中，视频到音频同步可能会有一个小延迟。例如，如果你配对看电视，听/看。总的来说，非常高兴。伟大的建设质量和伟大的后续行动的东佐团队。他们显然很在乎。

One was returned, the other two were ""meh"" and I'll keep them for backups or something, but these are definitely keepers.  Based on the pictures I thought they'd probably be heavy and/or would fall out, but they paired very easily (to my desktop PC with a 4.2 bluetooth dongle), sound great, and really are very light.  I can barely feel them, and they don't fall out.  Personally, I like sitting with just one in my ear so I can still hear if the kids want something or the SO has a question (and when I'm walking the dogs so I can hear traffic) and these are fine in that respect.

Pull your ear back and insert each headphone in while twisting it clockwise. Once you let go of your ear the plastic piece will form to your war canal and create a perfect fit.

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,243,5,"I really wanted to like these earbuds, and at first I did. But I’ve tried various different sizes of the rubber tips it comes with and I still can’t get them to stay in when doing a workout that requires a lot of jumping and/or moving around, and I’m constantly adjusting them to make sure they’re firmly in place. I’m switching back to my other ones which, although not “true” wireless, at least the ear tips have a small hook that keep them in my ears. Maybe it just the way my ears are shaped but these weren’t for me.UPDATE:The seller contacted me after the initial review and wanted to make sure nothing was wrong or defective with the unit. I explained that I thought it was simply a poor design and not suited for intense exercise. They were eager to make things right and offered a different model free of charge. When I declined, they offered a refund on the original item with no need to send them back. Unbelievable customer service. I have no doubt they ultimately wanted an updated, positive review and I am more than happy to do so. Updated to five stars because they refunded my money immediately and were truly interested in make me a satisfied customer one way or another.","我真的很想喜欢这些耳塞，一开始我就喜欢了。但我试过各种不同尺寸的橡胶头，在做需要大量跳跃和/或走动的运动时，我仍然无法让它们留在身体里，我不断地调整它们，以确保它们牢固就位。我要换回其他的，虽然不是真正的无线，但至少耳尖有一个小钩子可以把它们留在我的耳朵里
也许这只是我耳朵的形状，但对我来说不是这样的。更新：卖家在最初的审查后联系我，希望确保没有任何问题或缺陷的单位。我解释说，我认为这只是一个糟糕的设计，不适合激烈的运动。他们渴望把事情做对，并免费提供一种不同的模式。当我拒绝的时候，他们提供了一个原始项目的退款，不需要寄回去。难以置信的客户服务
我毫不怀疑他们最终想要一个更新的，积极的评论，我非常高兴这样做。更新为五星，因为他们立即退还了我的钱，并真正有兴趣使我成为一个满意的客户或其他方式。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,244,5,"I just got these today and I have to say that I'm impressed. The sound quality is very good for the price range. You can hear all the highs, mids, and feel the beat of the bass in your ear. Voices sound clear and undistorted. From out of the box and paired to my iPhone XS it took less than a minute. The battery only lasts 3 hours for music and 5 hours for talk so if that's important to you then you might want to consider other options. However with that being said the case can recharge the headphones up to 4 times before having to be recharged itself. The manual claims a 20-minute quick charge will get you 1 hour of life. They fit snugly in my ear without any discomfort and stay there just fine. There are different sized cushions for differently sized ear canals. Both the case and the headphones are waterproof. I've seen some people complain about these not working underwater. The manual clearly states with visuals that these will not work underwater as Bluetooth signal bounces off the surface of the water. If you were to ask me I'd say go ahead and buy them. Even if they aren't your main pair of true wireless earbuds then they'd make an excellent backup pair.","我今天刚拿到这些，我不得不说我印象深刻。音质对价格范围来说非常好。你可以听到所有的高音，中音，感觉到耳边低音的节拍。声音听起来清晰而不失真。从开箱即用，配对到我的iPhone XS只用了不到一分钟。电池只支持3小时的音乐和5小时的通话，所以如果这对你很重要，你可能会考虑其他选择
不过，尽管如此，手机壳在充电前可以给耳机充电4次。手册上说20分钟的快速充电可以让你获得1小时的生命。它们紧贴在我的耳朵里，没有任何不适，呆在那里也很好。不同大小的耳道有不同大小的软垫。箱子和耳机都是防水的。我见过一些人抱怨这些东西在水下不起作用
该手册清楚地以视觉形式说明，当蓝牙信号从水面反弹时，这些设备在水下不起作用。如果你问我，我会说去买吧。即使他们不是你真正的无线耳塞的主要配对，那么他们将是一个优秀的备份配对。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,247,5,"Color me impressed! I first fell in love with wireless earbuds with taotronics. However i wanted to use them to sleep with and they do not fit comfortably laying on them. They also shorted out in the shower which scared me since they are supposed to be water proof. Enter TOZO T10. I took a chance since the profile seemed smaller and it  paid off! First thing i did was try them in the shower no problem at all! Washed my hair and everything lol. I'm a side sleeper and am able to fall asleep comfortably listening to my audio books. Big thing for people is sound quality i must say these SURPASSED my expectations! I can't even listen past half volume, deep bass, clear sounds and no crackles super impressed! The magnets in the charger are very strong no issues of them falling out and the case is sturdier and battery life longer than my taotronics set. I haven't used those since i got these! Only weird thing i noticed is if you put your hand up close to the non master side the volume fades on that side it's quirky but not annoying lol. I fully endorse these you will love love love them!","让我印象深刻！我第一次爱上了淘宝的无线耳机。不过，我想用它们睡觉，它们不适合舒适地躺在上面。它们在淋浴时也短路了，这让我害怕，因为它们应该是防水的。输入TOZO T10。我抓住了一个机会，因为个人资料似乎较小，并得到了回报！我做的第一件事就是在洗澡的时候试试，没问题！洗头什么的
我是一个侧卧者，能舒服地睡着听我的有声读物。对人们来说，最重要的是音质，我必须说这些超出了我的期望！我甚至听不到过去的半个音量，低音，清晰的声音和没有超级印象深刻的噼啪声！充电器里的磁铁很强，没有掉出来的问题，而且外壳比我的taotronics套装更坚固，电池寿命更长
我买了这些就没用过！我注意到的唯一奇怪的事情是，如果你把你的手放在靠近非主边的地方，那边的音量会变暗，这很奇怪，但并不烦人，哈哈。我完全赞同这些，你会喜欢的，爱他们！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,246,5,"This is my second pair of TOZO ear buds. I had the T-8 before, and this is a definite step up. I only replaced the T8 because I lost one. TOZO earbuds work seamlessly with my iPhone. Syncing is never a problem. I like that you pick them up out of the charger and they automatically turn on and pair. These earbuds have a great sound with deeper base than anything I’ve heard except my noise-canceling OTE headphones. They are sturdy and well built but not bulky in my ear. I am often asked about them and my answer is always the same: a much cheaper option than AirPods but a high quality too.","这是我的第二对耳塞。我以前有过T-8，这是一个明显的进步。我只是换了T8因为我丢了一个。TOZO耳塞与我的iPhone完美结合。同步从来都不是问题。我喜欢你把它们从充电器里拿出来，它们会自动打开并配对。这些耳塞有一个伟大的声音与更深的基础，比我听到的任何东西，除了我的噪音消除OTE耳机。它们很结实，结构很好，但在我的耳朵里并不笨重
我经常被问到它们，我的回答总是一样的：比AirPods便宜得多，但质量也很高。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,243,5,"I have only owned these earphones for one day (purchased them for $27 on a Lightning Deal), so this ""review"" is really just my first impressions.  I'll update this review if any issues come up that make me reconsider my feelings on IEMs.  I am not a hardcore audiophile, but I do appreciate quality headphones and earphones.  I'll talk first about my intial impression of the build quality, set up and bluetooth performance and sound quality.The build quality on these Tozo T2 is pretty darn good.  The case is well made and very solidly assembled.  I have no doubt it can handle a good drop from your pocket onto concrete.  I also don't doubt Tozo's claim that the case has an IPX8 rating (and I usually take those types of claims from chinese manufacturers with huge grains of salt).  The micro USB port on the case is covered by a rubber seal and the case shuts firmly and is held in place by three heavy earth magnets.  The same type of magnets are also used to hold the earbuds in the case when they are charging.  They aren't going to rattle loose or pop out unless you want them to come out.  The earbuds are also really well made.  They have a very solid feel and the plastic doesn't feel cheap at all.  Because of these are TWB earphones, they are not the lightest I have used though and, overall, they feel heavier than typical wired bluetooth IEMs.  This isn't really a big deal, since I had no issue using them through my workout at the gym this morning, including HIIT session on the treadmill and an intense weight training session.  I also tested the Tozo's claims of IPX8 water resistance rating by giving them a wash in the sink and using them in the shower.  The held up just fine and it was nice to be able to listen to my tunes during a shower!!!  This capability makes these earphones perfect for the beach or pool, where you wouldn't risk more expensive and/or delicate earphones.As for the feature set, I really like the fact that the case for these earphones can be charged using a qi wireless charger.  I could have lived with the micro USB, but this just makes the process of charging the case (and earphones) so much easier!!  On the other hand, these phones have one button on each bud that controls your phone.  Click once and it will pause your music.  Click again and the music will restart.  Those are only media functions these buttons serve.  Other than that, the buttons are used for accepting, rejecting or hanging up on phone calls.  It would have been nice if you could use them to change music tracks and control the volume.  Other earphones in this price range ($40 list price) have these capabilities, but they don't have the waterproof rating or the wireless charging capability.  So, you have to choose what is more important to you.As for bluetooth connectivity, set up is as easy as everyone claims.  Take the IEMs out the case, they go into pairing mode and connect to each other.  They show up as available on your phone's bluetooth menu, and you click on the right earphone--that's it.  The automatically turn on and connect to the phone when the IEMs are removed from the case.  This makes them very simple and easy to use.  Due to their size (although they are not large by any means), it does take a little longer to get them comfortably situated in your ear than most wired IEMs (bluetooth or otherwise).  This is probably true for most TWB IEMs (with a few exceptions).  Once situated, they do stay where they are suppose to, although you need to make sure you are using the correct sized earphone tips.  The medium sized silicone tips that came pre-installed on the earphones fit me just fine and held the earphones firmly in place.  However, I am currently using a pair a medium sized comply foam tips (they did not come with the earphones), since they are comfortable and hold the earphone securely in place (and create a better seal than silicon tips IMO).Before I get into sound quality, this is an element that is very subjective.  Although I am not a hardcore audiophile, I care about sound quality and have invested in  some well respected headphones and IEMs (Grado S80s, Audio Technica ATH-M50X, Shure SE425, Tin Audio T2, KZ AOS10 etc)..  I tend to like a earphones that have a fairly neutral sound, but are capable of generating tight controlled base (which can be brought out using the equalizer on your phone or tablet).  These are NOT neutral sounding earphones.  In fact, it sounds to me as if Tozo designed these earphones with a fixed EQ setting that overly emphasizes bass (particularly in the lower and mid range).  This causes the bass to bleed over into the mids.  If you ever listened to a 5.1 surround sound system where the subwoofer's crossover is set too high and at too high of a volume (creating that booming/overwhelming sound), these earphones have that effect.  There is also some sibalence in these earphones--far from the worst I heard, but it is definitely present (especially for female vocals).  These are earphones that are tuned for bassheads, but the 8mm drivers used by Tozo don't have the chops to really deliver clean quality bass.  Tozo would have been better off not trying to put a fixed EQ setting in these earphones and left them with a balanced setting, which anyone can tweak to their taste using the EQ on their phone.In short, these are NOT the best sounding earphones I have ever heard.  The sound quality is on par with a set of wired Philips Extra Bass headphones that you can buy for $15 at CVS or Rite Aid (which is they type of earphone that most people use).  What makes them special is the fact that for $39 ($27 if you got them on a lightening deal), ,these earphones are rugged TWB earphones that are waterproof, come with a waterproof case that also serves as wireless charging base, and is, itself, capable of being charged with a Qi wireless charger.  They aren't going to replace my Shure SE425, but they will compete with my superior sounding Tin Audio T2 (which I have connected via an MMCX Fiio bluetooth cable) for time at the gym and certainly during the summer at the beach and pool.  I don't have much experience with other TWB earphones, but it doesn't seem like Tozo's competitors are offering anything significantly better in the sub-$50 range--so this is about as good as it gets for now (I am sure things will be much different in a year or two).","我只拥有这些耳机一天（以闪电般的价格27美元购买），所以这个“评论”真的只是我的第一印象。如果有什么问题让我重新考虑对IEMs的感受，我会更新这篇评论。我不是一个铁杆的音响发烧友，但我很欣赏高质量的耳机和耳机。我先谈谈我对构建质量、设置、蓝牙性能和音质的最初印象
这个箱子做得很好，组装得很牢固。我毫不怀疑它能很好地处理从你口袋里掉到混凝土上的一滴。我也不怀疑Tozo的说法，即本案的评级为IPX8（我通常接受那些来自中国生产商的、含大量盐的索赔）。外壳上的micro-USB端口由橡胶密封件覆盖，外壳牢固关闭，并由三块重地磁铁固定到位
同样类型的磁铁也被用来在充电时固定耳塞。除非你想让它们出来，否则它们不会嘎吱嘎吱地跑出来。耳塞也做得很好。他们有一个非常坚实的感觉和塑料不觉得便宜。因为这些是TWB耳机，它们不是我用过的最轻的，而且，总的来说，它们比典型的有线蓝牙IEM感觉更重
这其实没什么大不了的，因为我今天早上在健身房的锻炼中，包括在跑步机上的HIIT训练和高强度的举重训练，都没有问题。我还测试了Tozo声称的IPX8防水等级，让他们在水槽里洗一洗，然后在淋浴时使用
举行只是很好，它是很高兴能够听我的歌曲在淋浴期间！！！这一功能使这些耳机非常适合海滩或游泳池，在那里您不会冒着更贵和/或更精致的耳机的风险。至于功能设置，我真的很喜欢这些耳机的外壳可以使用qi无线充电器充电
我本来可以使用micro-USB，但这只会让手机壳（和耳机）的充电过程变得更容易！！另一方面，这些手机有一个按钮在每个花蕾，控制你的手机。单击一次，它将暂停您的音乐。再次单击，音乐将重新启动。这些按钮只提供媒体功能。除此之外，这些按钮还用于接听、拒绝或挂断电话
如果你能用它们来改变音乐曲目和控制音量，那就太好了。此价格范围内的其他耳机（标价40美元）也具备这些功能，但它们没有防水等级或无线充电功能。所以，你必须选择对你来说更重要的东西。至于蓝牙连接，设置起来就像每个人所说的那样简单。把IEM拿出来，它们进入配对模式并相互连接
它们显示在你手机的蓝牙菜单上，你点击右边的耳机――就这样。当IEM从手机壳中取出时，会自动打开并连接到手机。这使得它们非常简单易用。由于它们的尺寸（尽管它们无论如何都不大），要让它们舒适地放在你的耳朵里要比大多数有线iem（蓝牙或其他）花费更长的时间。这对大多数TWB iem来说可能是正确的（只有少数例外）
一旦定位，他们确实停留在他们应该呆的地方，虽然你需要确保你使用的是正确大小的耳机提示。预先安装在耳机上的中等尺寸硅胶头正好适合我，并将耳机牢牢固定在适当的位置。不过，我目前使用的是一对中等大小的符合泡沫塑料头（它们没有附带耳机），因为它们很舒适，并将耳机牢固地固定在适当的位置（并且比IMO的硅头密封性更好）
在我进入音质之前，这是一个非常主观的因素。虽然我不是一个铁杆的音响发烧友，但我关心音质，并投资了一些备受尊敬的耳机和IEM（Grado S80、Audio Technica ATH-M50X、舒尔SE425、Tin Audio T2、KZ AOS10等）。。我喜欢一个声音相当中性的耳机，但是能够产生紧凑的控制基座（可以通过手机或平板电脑上的均衡器来实现）
这不是中性的耳机。事实上，在我看来，Tozo设计这些耳机时采用了固定的EQ设置，过度强调低音（尤其是中低音）。这会导致低音流到中间。如果你曾经听过5.1环绕音响系统，其中低音炮的分频器设置得太高，音量太大（产生那种轰鸣/压倒性的声音），这些耳机就会产生这种效果
在这些耳机里也有一些sibalence――远不是我听过的最差的，但它绝对是存在的（特别是对女声来说）。这些耳机都是为低音炮调谐的，但东佐使用的8毫米驱动程序并不能真正提供干净的低音质量。Tozo最好不要在这些耳机中设置固定的EQ设置，而给它们设置一个平衡的设置，任何人都可以通过手机上的EQ来调整它们的口味
简而言之，这不是我听过的最好的耳机。音质与一套有线飞利浦额外低音耳机不相上下，您可以在CVS或Rite Aid购买15美元（这是大多数人使用的耳机类型）
特别之处在于，这款耳机售价39美元（约合27美元，如果你买的是闪电耳机的话），是一款坚固耐用的TWB耳机，防水外壳也可以作为无线充电基座，而且本身可以用Qi无线充电器充电
他们不会取代我的舒尔SE425，但他们会在健身房和夏天的海滩和游泳池与我卓越的Tin音频T2（我通过MMCX Fiio蓝牙电缆连接）竞争时间
我对其他TWB耳机没有太多经验，但似乎Tozo的竞争对手在低于50美元的价位上并没有提供更好的产品，所以这和现在差不多（我相信一两年后情况会大不相同）。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,240,5,"The last time I bought a wireless headphone is last year with a Bose Quiet Comfort II. Owning another two wireless headphones from Taoelectronics in addition to the Bose, I do not have much expectation for this pair of tiny earbuds, but I was blown out of the water when first putting them on. The sound quality is vibrant and deep, and very comfortable, does not feel heavy at all.I read many reviews before buying that mentioned about the lack of bass, which I found the complete opposite as these earbuds are kickin' hard, in which I have to turn down the volume. Technology has advanced so much in the past few years, and these earbuds surpass my Taoelectronics headphones (Vava Moov 25) in 2014 by a mile.I usually do not care much about the box presentation, but the company Tozo paid attention to their packaging. Outside is a clear plastic cover and the box construction is solid and well-made. I cannot justify spending more than $150 for a pair of Apple Airpods with a worse water-proof rating and sound quality.The battery case is very well made and sturdy, the earbuds themselves are well made and completely sealed off so I will test using them under the rainy weather while working out. I hesitated to invest $40 in these earbuds, but this turns out to be the best upgrades ever. I will sure use these earbuds as much as my Bose QuietComfort II.","我最后一次买无线耳机是去年的一款Bose安静舒适II。除了Bose，我还拥有两个来自淘电子的无线耳机，我对这副小小的耳塞并没有太大的期望，但当我第一次戴上它们的时候，我就被吹出了水面。音质活泼深沉，非常舒适，一点也不重
在购买之前，我读了很多评论，其中提到缺少低音，我发现完全相反，因为这些耳塞很硬，我不得不调低音量。在过去的几年里，技术进步了很多，2014年，这些耳塞比我的Taoelectronics耳机（Vava Moov 25）高出了一英里。我通常不太在意盒子的展示，但Tozo公司很注意它们的包装
外面是一个透明的塑料罩，盒子结构坚固，制作精良。我没理由花超过150美元买一对防水性能和音质较差的苹果Airpods。电池盒制作精良，坚固耐用，耳塞本身制作精良，完全密封，所以我会在雨天锻炼时测试使用。我犹豫要不要花40美元买这些耳塞，但这是有史以来最好的升级

The shipping box and packaging are also very impressive. Also, they were charged when I received them so I could use them right away.

同时，双方都有联系的确认也排除了任何疑问。电话很容易接，而且很清楚。这个手提箱非常耐用，而且体积小，很容易塞进袋子或口袋里，以便外出时使用。运输箱和包装也给人留下了深刻的印象。而且，当我收到它们时，它们就被指控了，这样我就可以立即使用它们。我不得不再说一次，我对不同尺寸的耳罩是多么的满意。。可能是我最喜欢的功能

We took our time to set it up for her and for her to choice the correct earbud for correct placement.These sound better then my apple AirPods.The sound is crisp, clear bass and when we tried talking on the phone there was no echo.Great purchase, super friendly my daughter was also already asking for a pair.","我给我妻子买了这些耳机。她有一份很忙的工作，她需要在电话上说，并决定这些，因为他们看起来超级方便与充电电缆usb。她爱他们。我们花了很多时间为她准备，让她选择正确的耳塞来正确放置。这些声音比我的苹果AirPods好。声音清脆，低音清晰，当我们试着打电话时没有回音
很好的购买，超级友好我女儿也已经要求一双了。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,185,5,"I needed a new pair of earbuds for work and my wife surprised me with these. At first I was a little skeptical because I've never heard of the brand, but I gave these a chance and I was pleasantly surprised with the sound and build quality. I've owned many of the high dollar brands before and these sound, look and feel way more expensive than they are. For the price you can't go wrong. They are waterproof (I use them in the shower), come with their own wireless charging case, the cancel out noise very well and they sound AWESOME! I was a little worried they wouldn't be loud enough, but they are plenty loud. They are as loud as your phone or other device will allow. For these features and quality you should expect to spend many more times the asking price, but TOZO is doing us all a favor and are offering these at a great deal.I did have an issue with my set though when they first came in... At first they worked awesome but out of nowhere the right earbud just stopped working and nothing I tried would resolve the issue. Fortunately these come with a warranty (which is another thing you won't find at this low price point) so I contacted customer service and they helped resolve my issue straight away. Customer service was helpful, polite and FAST to act on my issues and everything has been sorted out to my satisfaction.TOZO gained a fan for the long haul in me and I'm excited to try their other product lines. If you are on the fence, just get these T10 earbuds and I'm sure you'll love them. The product is great and customer service is great. Save the money you would spend on a far more expensive product and use that to buy some more music.","我工作需要一副新的耳塞，我妻子用这个给我一个惊喜。一开始我有点怀疑，因为我从来没有听说过这个品牌，但我给了这个机会，我对声音和质量感到惊喜。我以前拥有过很多高价位的品牌，这些声音、外观和感觉都比现在贵得多。以你不会出错的价格
它们是防水的（我在淋浴时使用），自带无线充电箱，取消噪音非常好，听起来棒极了！我有点担心他们不够大声，但他们足够大声。它们的音量是你的手机或其他设备所允许的。对于这些特点和质量，你应该期望花更多的倍的要价，但东佐是帮我们所有人的忙，并提供这些在很大程度上
当他们第一次进来的时候，我确实和我的电视机有问题。。。一开始他们工作得很好，但不知从何而来的右耳塞只是停止工作，我没有试图解决这个问题。幸运的是，这些都有保修（这是另一件事，你不会发现在这个低价点），所以我联系了客户服务，他们帮助解决了我的问题立即。客户服务很有帮助，很有礼貌，处理我的问题很快，一切都解决得很满意
TOZO在我心中赢得了一个长期的粉丝，我很高兴尝试他们的其他产品线。如果你在围栏上，只要把这些T10耳塞，我相信你会喜欢的。产品很好，客户服务也很好。把你花在更贵产品上的钱省下来，然后用这些钱买更多的音乐。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,192,5,"I have to say that I have a pair of Bosè QC-35 as my primary headphones. But in summer they get steamy, and for travelling they are rather big, so I started to look for some more portable and smaller headphones. I didn't want to pay $150 for some Apple AirPods, so I did a research and found this TOZO.  And I love them. I've had them for a couple of weeks, and I'm still on the ""you're-the-love-of-my-life"" phase; so, I will try to be as objective as possible.[Sound Quality]Powerful basses and crisp higher notes. Once you fit your earbuds correctly, you will feel amazed by the bass sound. Choose the ear cushions that fit snuggle and comfortable, but don't let any gaps in your ears.[Comfortability]They come with 4 sizes of ear cushions, so for sure you will have a pair that fits you correctly. As I said above, choose the ones that fit comfortable and does not leave gaps in your ears for better sound quality.[Noise Isolation]Fantastic. I used them in the airplane, and you hardly notice you're flying. I use them at the office and people have to wave their hands to me, because I don't listen a thing outside my music (volume at 70%).[Battery Life]I've been using them for 10 days, 1 hour a day aproximately. This is the first time I recharge the base. So, I could say that total battery life, including base charge is around 10 hours.[Waterproof]I took a shower with them. Worked perfectly.[Other Things]Pairing is easy. Though somehow I turn them off, and store them in the case, and after a while they re-connect to my iPhone. What I did was ""disconnect"" the earbuds in the iPhone settings and it stopped completely. Now I have to manually connect them to the iPhone everytime I use them. No big deal.[Overall]You don't have to pay $150 for AirPods. Yes, they are more fancy, look nicer and they are connected to Siri, but I don't think the price difference is worth it. So far, I'm in love with this TOZO earbuds.","我不得不说我有一副BosèQC-35作为我的主要耳机。但到了夏天，它们会变得潮湿，而且旅行时它们很大，所以我开始寻找一些更轻便、更小的耳机。我不想花150美元买苹果的AirPods，所以我做了一个调查，找到了这个TOZO。我爱他们。我已经吃了几个星期了，我还处在“你是我生命中最爱的人”的阶段，所以，我会尽量客观
[音质]强劲的低音和清脆的高音。一旦你正确地戴上耳塞，你会对低音感到惊讶。选择合身舒适的耳垫，但不要让耳朵有任何空隙。[舒适性]它们有4种尺寸的耳垫，所以一定要有一双适合你的。正如我上面所说，选择那些适合你的耳朵并且不会在你的耳朵上留下空隙的，以获得更好的音质
我在飞机上用过，你几乎没注意到你在飞行。我在办公室使用它们，人们不得不向我挥手致意，因为我听不到音乐之外的任何东西（音量为70%）[电池寿命]我已经使用了10天，大约每天1小时。这是我第一次给基地充电。所以，我可以说电池的总寿命，包括基本充电大约是10个小时。工作得很好。[其他事情]配对很容易
但不知怎么的，我把它们关掉了，放在手机壳里，过了一会儿，它们又重新连接到我的iPhone上。我所做的是在iPhone设置中“断开”耳塞，然后它就完全停止了。现在我每次使用它们时都要手动将它们连接到iPhone。没什么大不了的。[总的来说]你不必为AirPods支付150美元。是的，它们更花哨，看起来更漂亮，而且与Siri有联系，但我认为价格差异不值得。到目前为止，我爱上了这个玩具耳塞。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,184,5,"I was highly impressed at the sound quality of these earbuds! Great noise cancellation, great bass, and all around great sound! The bluetooth range is highly impressive as well. I am most impressed by the battery life, at 4 to 5 hours of listen time and approximately an hour for a full charge. The battery pack can charge the earbuds 3 to 4 times before it needs to charged too, which is much better than I anticipated.I also need to add what wonderful customer service I recieved from the company! I accidentally put one headphone in the washer with my jeans, for about 5 minutes, and the headphone broke. The company was more than happy to issue me a replacement pair, no hassle and no run around! I highly recommend these earbuds and this company. Five stars isnt enough!","我对这些耳塞的音质印象深刻！伟大的噪音消除，伟大的低音，和周围伟大的声音！蓝牙范围也非常令人印象深刻。我对电池的寿命印象最深，在4到5小时的收听时间和大约一个小时的完全充电。电池组也可以在需要充电前给耳塞充电3到4次，比我预想的要好得多
我还需要补充一下，我从公司得到了多么棒的客户服务！我不小心把一个耳机和牛仔裤放进洗衣机里，大约5分钟，耳机坏了。公司非常乐意给我换一双，没有麻烦，也没有跑路！我强烈推荐这些耳塞和这家公司。五星还不够！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,204,5,"I’m really pleased with these earbuds. They are well made and sound great. I was even surprised by the charging box and how the earbuds snap into their dock with magnets. Although they came fitted with silicone earcaps that were too big for my ears, they also come with other sizes so I was able to easily change them out. They feel snug and comfortable now. I also like that they are waterproof - I’ve worn them in the shower and can’t wait to wear them this summer in the pool.I debated on putting 4 or 5 stars (would give a 4.5 if I could), and the that’s only because the charging box doesn’t seem to hold a charge as long as I would expect. The earbuds themselves last for most of the day of continuous play, but when they’re in the box they’re constantly charging and that drains the battery on the box. But in the big scheme of things that’s not a major problem, especially if you carry a backup battery around like I do for my phone.","我对这些耳塞很满意。它们制作精良，听起来很棒。我甚至对充电箱和耳塞是如何用磁铁卡入基座感到惊讶。虽然它们配有硅胶耳罩，对我的耳朵来说太大了，但它们也有其他尺寸，所以我可以很容易地把它们换掉。他们现在感到舒适舒适。我也喜欢防水的――我在淋浴时就穿了，今年夏天就迫不及待地想在游泳池里穿了
我考虑过放4或5颗星（如果可以的话，我会给4.5颗星），这只是因为充电箱似乎不像我预期的那样长时间充电。耳塞本身可以持续一天的大部分时间，但当它们在盒子里时，它们会不断地充电，这会耗尽盒子里的电池。但在大计划中，这不是一个大问题，特别是如果你像我一样随身携带备用电池。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,197,5,Great Value. Got on Amazon to just find some quality ear plugs for swimming.  Stumbled across these and for the negligible price difference decided to go with these. They fit great I am a big guy but have small ear canals so having the different adapters was really nice. I had to use the smallest. They are comfortable and have no problem staying in when working out or even swimming.  While they are water resistant they are not 100% water proof in that you can't just drop them in the pool or wash them under running water. As long as they are in your ear they are waterproof providing they have a good seal in your ears and your not diving beyond 3 feet. Sound is good. I'm no HIFI expert but the sound is good with high highs and good bass response as well. Range is great. Note when swimming that when you go under the water the sound will break up or cut out all together due to the signal being blocked by the water. This is not the fault of the earbuds themselves.,"很有价值。上亚马逊只是为了找到一些游泳用的优质耳塞。偶然发现了这些，为了微不足道的价格差异，决定采用这些。它们非常适合我是一个大家伙，但有小耳道，所以有不同的适配器真的很好。我不得不用最小的。他们很舒服，在运动甚至游泳时呆在家里都没有问题
虽然它们是防水的，但它们并不是100%防水的，因为你不能直接把它们扔进游泳池或在自来水下清洗。只要它们在你的耳朵里，它们是防水的，只要它们在你的耳朵里有一个很好的密封，你不能潜水超过3英尺。声音很好。我不是高保真专家，但声音很好，高音和低音也很好。范围很广
游泳时请注意，当你在水下游泳时，由于信号被水挡住，声音会破裂或全部消失。这不是耳塞本身的错。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,191,5,"Ok I have been looking for weeks on Amazon for a good pair of affordable True Wireless Earbuds and originally had purchased the Sandoo Earbuds. When the Sandoo earbuds came in I was so excited, but that excited lasted about half a day because the ear buds would cut in and out if you even thought of touching them and they sounded terrible as well. The Sandoo earbuds were $10 less than the Tozo Earbuds, but they were recommended by Amazon so I decided why not buy them to have one more shot at finding a good pair of true wireless earbuds before I gave up. The Tozo earbuds showed up at my house and I couldn't wait to open them up to see if they actually worked as advertised and omg WOW WOW WOW!!! They most certainly do what they promised and sound amazing. From the packaging to the actual product itself I am literally amazed. I mean only Apple has a system like that where the packaging is just as nice as the product and Tozo you are knocking things out of the park. How do Apple Earpods cost so much when the Tozo earbuds sounds just brilliant. The bass is awesome, the mods are awesome and the highs are awesome and not to mention I use these while working out in my garden and then come inside and jump right into the shower with the ear buds still on never missing a beat. I will recommend your products to anyone I know looking for things that y'all sell. Thank you so much for making this skeptical man a happy man.","好吧，我已经在亚马逊上找了好几个星期了，想买一双价格实惠的真正的无线耳塞，最初我买了Sandoo耳塞。当桑多耳塞进来的时候，我非常兴奋，但这种兴奋持续了半天，因为如果你想触摸它们，耳塞就会断断续续地插进来，而且听起来也很可怕
Sandoo的耳塞比Tozo的耳塞便宜10美元，但是亚马逊推荐了它们，所以我决定在我放弃之前，为什么不再买一副好的无线耳塞呢。Tozo耳塞出现在我家，我迫不及待地想把它们打开看看它们是否真的像广告上说的那样工作，天哪，哇哦！！！他们肯定会按照承诺去做，而且听起来很神奇。从包装到产品本身，我真的很惊讶
我的意思是，只有苹果有这样一个系统，它的包装和产品一样好，而且你会把东西弄得一塌糊涂。当Tozo耳塞听起来很漂亮的时候，苹果耳塞怎么会这么贵呢。低音棒极了，多功能模块棒极了，高音棒极了，更不用说我在花园里锻炼的时候就用上了，然后进来就跳到淋浴间里，耳塞还开着，一点节拍都没掉
我会把你们的产品推荐给任何一个我认识的寻找你们销售的东西的人。非常感谢你让这个多疑的人成为一个快乐的人。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: WHITE,185,5,"I've gone through several wireless ear buds in my day, and this one really works well. The sound quality is good (not for audiophiles, but for your average music listener). The design is sleek and can easily fit in my pocket; the case and the buds also look pretty good, though I would say it looks a wee bit bulky; I personally prefer the white. I haven't had any concerns of these buds falling out of my ear with the standard fit it came with (there are other fits supported as well) while biking and some gentle walking; very minimal re-adjustment is ever needed maybe every hour or so. The price point makes this particularly attractive. I've also had very little issue with the battery life, being able to listen for several hours without any threat of the buds dying. The nice thing is the charging case, so you can re-charge on the go up to 4 full charges! That's awesome. The fact that the charging case works with wireless charging is just extra icing on the cake here.","我一天经历了好几次无线耳塞，这次真的很管用。音质很好（不适合音响发烧友，但适合一般的音乐听众）。这个设计很时尚，很容易放在我的口袋里；这个箱子和花蕾也很好看，虽然我觉得它看起来有点笨重；我个人更喜欢白色的
我不担心这些花蕾会从我的耳朵里掉出来，因为它在骑车和散步的时候有标准的合身度（还有其他的合身度也有支撑）；可能每小时左右都需要非常小的重新调整。这个价格点使它特别有吸引力。我对电池寿命也没什么问题，能听上几个小时而不至于让电池死掉
好的是充电箱，所以你可以重新充电，最多4个完整的收费！太棒了。充电箱可以与无线充电配合使用，这只是锦上添花。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,187,5,"The sound quality of the TOZO T10 TWS Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds is the best I have ever experienced and because of the tightly fit of the ear caps, the outside noises are mostly reduced into muffled sound which makes the music coming out of the earpieces crystal clear and seemingly coming from all directions. This pair of masterpiece also boasts of its deep bass which makes you feel more like in a theater enjoying live band!The most crucial thing is to choose the right size ear caps that fit your just right.

Allows me to have a conversation while being able to listen to music. I've owned so many earbuds but this is the best for using while my head was in a pillow which helped me recuperate while being sick. Even with all of these features, the best was the customer support and follow up from the company. It's been a long time since I've had a company that I actually felt cared about my experience. Will buy many products from them in the future.","产品运行良好。很容易配对，使用也很方便。我喜欢在把另一个放在箱子里的时候使用右耳塞的能力。允许我边听音乐边聊天。我有这么多耳塞，但这是最好的使用，而我的头是一个枕头，帮助我康复时生病。即使有所有这些功能，最好的还是来自公司的客户支持和跟进

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,238,1,"Edit: these will not stay connected to each other.These headphones felt more expensive than they are. The volume is great. It would be better if double click skipped to the next song. They work great if you stay inside and sit still on the couch, unmoving. The minute I step outside with these, they constantly drop connection with each other and cut in and out. These headphones seem to work perfectly with my Chromebook but kinda wonky with my iphone. They are good for $30-40 headphones if you sit still in your house.","编辑：这些耳机不会保持相互连接。这些耳机感觉比现在贵。音量很大。如果双击跳过下一首歌会更好。如果你呆在家里，一动不动地坐在沙发上，它们就很管用。我一出门，他们就不停地互相拆线。这些耳机似乎与我的Chromebook完美配合，但与我的iphone有点不搭调

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,164,5,"I received these yesterday and love that they came almost fully charged. I connected them right away (I was excited for new headphones, haha.)  I've listened to a few other branded headphones and they were sub par at best. These actually have a full sound. The fit of the ear buds is important, but I immediately switched to the small ear bud size knowing that's what I need. I was definitely not disappointed. These have such full sound. They have full bass and highs without being tinny. The sound is very clear and not muddy. I have daith piercings in both ears and due to these I have a hard time finding ear buds that are comfortable for long wear. These have been great. I've been wearing them all morning. I love that they cancel the noise of the room around me. I can't hear anything when music is going and everything is so much quieter if there is no music going. I love that if I leave the left ear bud in the charging case that it automatically switches the right bud to full sound instead of stereo. (I have quite a few songs that have sound for only left and right ear that pan accordingly but when only one ear bud is synced you don't lose those pieces. I work where I need to use just one ear bud sometimes and so this is an important feature for me. These have great range around the house. I can leave my phone in one room and be in a different room and still have clear sound. I've had problems with other brands and my phone being in my back pocket and cutting out but that's not an issue with these. I have only made one call so far  but the person on the other side said it was clear and easy to hear me. Its easier for me to hear the other person with these than with the iPhone speaker.I will update once I've had these a little longer.EDIT: I’ve had these for 9 months now and they still have stellar sound. They are comfortable. I don’t get complaints from the people I call. They charge quickly and hold their charge well. I still highly recommend.UPDATE 2:I am one month shy of owning these for a year and the right channel will not hold a charge. I use the left channel by itself often and it holds the charge just fine. I don't know if the right one is just defective or if my left one just got lucky on the battery life.","我昨天收到了这些，很高兴它们几乎充满了电。我马上接通了它们（我对新的耳机很兴奋，哈哈）我听过一些其他品牌的耳机，它们充其量是低于标准的。这些真的有一个完整的声音。耳塞的合适度很重要，但我知道这是我需要的，所以我马上就换了小耳塞的尺寸。我绝对没有失望。这些声音很饱满。他们的低音和高音都很饱满，但并不刺耳
声音很清楚，不浑浊。我的双耳都有戴丝穿孔，因此我很难找到适合长时间佩戴的耳塞。这些都很棒。我穿了一上午了。我喜欢他们消除了我周围房间的噪音。当音乐响起时，我什么都听不到，如果没有音乐响起，一切都会安静得多
我喜欢这样，如果我把左耳塞放在充电箱里，它会自动把右耳塞换成全音而不是立体声。（我有很多歌曲只有左耳和右耳的声音，但当只有一个耳朵芽同步时，你不会失去这些片段。我工作的地方有时只需要使用一个耳塞，所以这是我的一个重要特点。房子周围的范围很大
我可以把手机放在一个房间里，在另一个房间里，声音仍然清晰。我有其他品牌的问题，我的手机在我的后口袋和削减，但这不是一个问题与这些。到目前为止，我只打了一个电话，但对方说很清楚，也很容易听到我的声音。对我来说，听别人说这些比用iPhone扬声器更容易。等我有了这些，我会更新的
编辑：我已经吃了9个月了，它们的声音仍然很好。它们很舒服。我没有接到打电话的人的投诉。他们冲锋很快，控球很好。我仍然强烈推荐。更新2：我有一个月的时间来拥有这些一年，正确的渠道将不会举行收费。我经常单独使用左声道，它可以很好地保持电荷。我不知道是右边的坏掉了，还是左边的坏掉了。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,157,3,"These have amazing sound and good battery life, but the most important feature of bluetooth headphones is staying connected.  When my phone is stationary on a counter and I'm walking around a room I experience no problems whatsoever.  But when my phone is in my pocket the earbuds disconnect consistently making them unusable.  Really wish this wasn't an issue because I love everything else about these.  Sending them back :(update:  Tozo sent me a second pair of these for free saying that they had fixed the connection issue.  Unfortunately it hadn't been fixed.  I'll reiterate the fact that these sound great and are really nice quality build along w/ the charging box.  It's also possible that it could be my phone (iPhone SE) but I found that if the phone is in my pocket the earbuds won't stay connected.  My wife used them at the gym and with her phone (also an iPhone SE) in a stationary position on the treadmill that she had no connection issues.  I changed my rating to a 3 star bc of tozo's customer service, I wish I could give it a 5 star but the connection issues are still there for me.","这些耳机有惊人的声音和良好的电池寿命，但蓝牙耳机最重要的特点是保持连接。当我的手机停在柜台上，在房间里走来走去时，我一点问题也没有。但当我的手机在口袋里时，耳塞总是断开，使它们无法使用。真希望这不是问题，因为我喜欢这一切
发回：（更新：Tozo免费给我发了第二对，说他们已经解决了连接问题。不幸的是，它没有被修复。我将重申一个事实，这些声音很好，是非常好的质量与充电箱一起建设。也有可能是我的手机（I phone SE），但我发现如果手机在我口袋里，耳塞就不会保持连接

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,127,5,"Let me start by saying these are terrific!  The build quality is solid, packaging and presentation are nicely done and the sound is truly surprisingly very good with much better bass than something this small normally has.  I'm very pleased with these.  I had a pair of Phaiser's wrap around Bluetooth earbuds and they were far more finicky and not durable.  So came here looking for a replacement and wanted something that could handle sweat and found the behind the wrap annoying.  So gave this shot and wow, these blow the Phaiser earbuds away.  The charging storage case is a great touch and a useful place to store these after a work out.  The only warning I'd make is these are tiny and dark, so if you drop one of them, which I did, they're not easy to find.  The unit comes with several sized ear cups,  the standard size turned out to be a bit too big for my ears, they include two sizes smaller and one size larger.  The smallest size works best for me.  So try them for fit before going on a run,  and change if needed.  I went with the standard size out and one fell out, when I began to sweat.  Wasn't easy to find in the early morning light, but did and no harm or issue with it.  I changed the cups when I got home and now the fit is more secure.  I'd buy these again in heart beat.  Love the freedom of this style of wireless headbuds.","让我先说这些太棒了！构建质量是坚实的，包装和演示都做得很好，声音真的令人惊讶地非常好，低音比这个小的通常有更好的东西。我对这些很满意。我有一对法瑟的蓝牙耳塞，它们更挑剔，不耐用。所以来这里找一个替代品，想要一些可以处理汗水的东西，发现包装后面很烦人
所以拍了这张照片，哇哦，这把发烧友的耳塞吹走了。充电存储箱是一个伟大的触摸和一个有用的地方存储这些工作后。我唯一要警告的是这些东西又小又黑，所以如果你扔下其中一个，我确实扔下了，它们不容易找到。这个单位配备了几个大小的耳罩，标准尺寸对我的耳朵来说有点太大了，包括两个小尺寸和一个大尺寸。最小的尺寸最适合我
所以在跑步前试着穿上，如果需要的话可以换上。当我开始出汗时，我把标准尺寸的衣服脱了出来，有一件掉了下来。在清晨的阳光下不容易找到，但却没有造成任何伤害或问题。回家后我换了杯子，现在合身更安全了。我会在心跳时再买一次。喜欢这种无线耳机的自由。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,118,5,"Here's my quick opinion: I'm a 45 year old guy, no audiophile and I wanted something cheap to use with my tablet so I could watch shows while in waiting rooms and sitting around.  These are perfect and I love them.Here's more detail:From the description page these Tozo T10 look a little cheap as well as the case. They are not at all. They seem very durable, the case is heavier than it looks and has 3 very strong little magnets that hold the lid shut. I thought the lid would be thin cheap plastic, but it's actually quite thick and seems sturdy. I take the whole case out of my work lunch box and toss it on the bed so I can charge it later and it stays shut. I even tried grabbing the case by the sides, and shook it, trying to get it to open and get the earbuds to fly out. They wont. Impressive.Wireless charging works great.The sound quality is great from these. Like I said, I watch movies on a kindle and using only 1 earbud, I have the  volume at about 75%. If I were to use both, I would be good at about 50%. I won't say these are extra loud, but should be plenty loud enough for most people.So after having these for a couple of days and using them, I am very, very happy for what I got for the price. As long as they last a while, they'll be perfect. I would definitely buy again.","我的观点很简单：我是一个45岁的人，不爱听音乐，我想用我的平板电脑买些便宜的东西，这样我就可以在候诊室和坐着看节目了。这些都是完美的，我喜欢。这里有更多的细节：从描述页这些Tozo T10看起来有点便宜，以及案件。他们一点也不。它们看起来很耐用，箱子比看上去重，有3个很强的小磁铁，可以把盖子关上
我原以为盖子是薄而便宜的塑料，但实际上很厚，而且看起来很结实。我把整个箱子从我的工作午餐盒里拿出来，扔在床上，这样我可以在以后充电，它就不动了。我甚至试着抓住箱子的两边，摇晃它，试着打开它，让耳塞飞出来。他们不会的。令人印象深刻。无线充电工作得很好。声音质量很好
就像我说的，我在kindle上看电影，只用一个耳塞，我的音量大约是75%。如果我同时使用这两种方法，我将擅长50%左右。我不会说这些声音特别大，但对大多数人来说应该足够大。所以在用了几天之后，我非常非常高兴能以这样的价格买到这些。只要他们坚持一段时间，他们就会完美。我一定会再买一次。

However, it is worth noting that shortly after ordering, I started receiving emails asking me to review the product and I would receive a free charging disc at no cost to me.I responded that I hadn't had the product long enough to warrant a true review and asked it a review was necessary to receive the product... no reply was given.Just saying beware about the high number of stars, I don't think it's a legit reflection of opinions.","仅供参考，我返回这些是因为音质不好，我与它有连接问题。不过，值得注意的是，在订购后不久，我就开始收到电子邮件，要求我审查产品，我将免费收到一张收费光盘。我回答说，我没有足够长的时间来保证一个真正的审查，并要求审查是必要的，以收到产品。。。没有答复

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,103,5,I bought these ear buds mostly to use while at work so I wanted them to be wireless and a bit discrete too. These earbuds are great for me. I was worried about buying earbuds off amazon cause of all the scammers out there but these have impressed me quite a bit. They are pretty small with a decent connection range and great sound quality. I was wondering how well they would stay in cause I would be moving around a lot and I also have pretty small ears but they stay great they come with different size buds which was great. And it also has a somewhat portable charger. It has a case that can hold about a four hour charge so u can charge ur buds while on the go if they die out on yay. Overall a great purchase for me I’ve recommended them to a few of my coworkers.,"我买的这些耳塞主要是在工作时使用的，所以我希望它们是无线的，也有点不连续。这些耳塞对我很好。我很担心从亚马逊购买耳塞，因为那里有很多骗子，但这些给我留下了很深的印象。它们很小，连接范围很好，音质也很好
我想知道他们会呆在那里有多好，因为我会经常走动，我也有很小的耳朵，但是他们很好，他们有不同大小的花蕾，这很好。它还有一个便携式充电器。它有一个能装四个小时电的箱子，这样你就可以在外出时给你的花蕾充电，如果它们死于yay。总的来说，这对我来说是一笔大买卖，我向我的一些同事推荐过。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,109,1,"The device itself, as headphones works great. The build quality is nice with a soft rubber finish. Being able to wireless-charge the buds with the case is a convenient feature. These fit me well and remain in place. These are also good at isolating you from outside noise.A major annoyance: I don't think you can use these in mono mode. The right bud will beep every 10 seconds or so if used alone. I think if you pull out the left bud, let it connect and replace it back in the case, the right bud will beep for 20 seconds (once per 10s interval) and then it seems to stop. An annoyance, but still a 5-star product at this point.The reason for the 1 star review:  the microphone is completely useless. It's not even sub-par or low quality. I call my work line using my cell and even with the right bud 2 inches from my mouth, my own voice felt like very low background noise -from far, far away.I really wanted to like these... but I'll have to return them.","设备本身，作为耳机工作得很好。建筑质量很好与软橡胶完成。能够无线充电的芽与案件是一个方便的功能。这些东西很适合我，而且还保持原样。它们也能很好地将你与外界的噪音隔离开来。一个主要的烦恼是：我认为你不能在单声道模式下使用它们。如果单独使用，正确的花蕾大约每10秒就会发出一次哔哔声
我想如果你拔出左芽，让它连接起来，然后把它放回箱子里，右芽会发出20秒的哔哔声（每10秒一次），然后它似乎停止了。一个烦恼，但在这一点上仍然是一个五星级产品。原因是一星级评论：麦克风是完全无用的。它甚至没有低于标准或低质量。我用手机打电话给我的工作线，即使是离嘴2英寸的右花蕾，我自己的声音也感觉像是很低的背景噪音――从很远很远的地方
我真的很想喜欢这些。。。但我得把它们还回去。
"
B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,86,5,"This was the first product that I really wanted to go out of the way to review the moment I turned them on. However, I wanted to give them some time to make sure that I would still be satisfied with them a few weeks down the line and all I can say is that I have never been more happier with a purchase. I really enjoy these.The moment I tried them, I was immediately impressed with the sound quality as it was multiple times better than the wired earphones that came with my Samsung Galaxy s9. With my previous earphones, I would still manage to have a hard time hearing the majority of audio even at maximum volume.However, now using these, I rarely even find myself putting the volume above the standard warning you receive when placing the volume too high. Even with my volume halfway, I can hear the audio in the same way as if it were at full volume. On top of that, the quality of the bass was immediately noticable and made everything so much more better to listen to.As well, many times before, I have found myself trying to find ways to where I could listen to music simultaneously while taking a shower or accomplishing other activities that tend to obstruct the clarity of music. With these, I don't have to worry about the possibility of my neighbors complaining about my music being too loud anymore. The fact that these are bluetooth and waterproof have really been useful to help cut out the middle man and take the music wherever I wish to listen to it. All without the cord in standard wired earphones getting caught up in things and getting tangled up by the time I pull them out of my pocket.It comes with extra sillicone ear buds, a charging usb cable, and that fabric cord (I dont know what it's called) that is used for the wireless charging container to be hung with. The charging container itself is magnetic which makes the lid durable, and it makes its grip on the bluetooth earbuds firm enough not to fall out when placed inside to charger.Some tips:1. I'm not sure if it comes with a brick to charge but I use a standard phone charger with the usb cable it comes with2. When taking them out to pair with phones, I sometimes have to take them out once, and instead place it back in to see the red lights, and take them out once more ready to be paired.3. I use multiple devices to transition between, such as my phone and my laptop. So if I'm using my laptop on the bus along with these earbuds and need to put my laptop away when I am getting off, I shut off my laptops bluetooth first before putting it away, and then turn on my phone's bluetooth to connect it with the Tozo Earbuds.And I do this process vice versa.I really couldn't be more excited to recommend these enough times. Great product!","这是我第一个真正想在开机的那一刻特意复习的产品。不过，我想给他们一些时间，以确保在接下来的几周里，我仍然对他们感到满意，我只能说，我从来没有像现在这样对他们更满意。我真的很喜欢这些。当我尝试的时候，我立刻对它的音质印象深刻，因为它比我的三星Galaxy s9附带的有线耳机好多倍
使用我以前的耳机，即使在最大音量的情况下，我仍然很难听到大部分的声音。但是，现在使用这些耳机，我甚至很少发现自己在音量过高时会将音量超过你收到的标准警告。即使把音量调到一半，我也能像听到满音量一样听到声音。除此之外，贝司的音质很快就被人注意到了，使一切听上去都好得多
还有，以前很多次，我发现自己试图找到一种方法，让我可以一边洗澡一边同时听音乐，或者完成其他可能妨碍音乐清晰度的活动。有了这些，我就不用担心邻居会抱怨我的音乐太吵了。事实上，这些是蓝牙和防水的，真的有助于减少中间人，把音乐带到我想听的任何地方
当我从口袋里掏出标准的有线耳机时，所有的耳机线都会被东西缠住和缠住。它还配有额外的硅橡胶耳塞、充电usb线和用来悬挂无线充电容器的织物线（我不知道叫什么）。充电容器本身是磁性的，这使得盖子耐用，而且它能牢牢抓住蓝牙耳机，放在充电器里时不会掉出来
一些提示：1。我不确定它是否带有一块砖头来充电，但我使用一个标准的带有usb线的手机充电器。当我带他们出去和手机配对时，我有时要把他们拿出来一次，然后放回去看红灯，然后再拿出来准备配对。我使用多个设备在两者之间切换，例如我的手机和笔记本电脑
所以，如果我在公交车上使用笔记本电脑和这些耳塞，下车时需要把笔记本电脑收起来，我会先关掉笔记本电脑的蓝牙，然后再收起来，然后打开手机的蓝牙，把它和Tozo耳机连接起来。我做这个过程，反之亦然。我真的很兴奋推荐这些足够的时间。很棒的产品！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,79,5,"I've only had these for a couple days, but I put my stuff through the wringer. I carry the mail in Ohio and I use these to listen to J. Vernon McGee's Thru the Bible while I walk. I have already had them out in the pouring rain and they worked perfectly. I'm no audiophile, but I hate tinny sounding cheap headphones. I'm extremely picky, and that's why I sent back a set of the mpow BT earbuds, and another that I can't remember the name of. Both sounded very cheap. These have deep bass, and are very loud. I deliver mail on a busy 4 lane and have absolutely no problem hearing the sermons.I am always moving and have never had one work its way loose. No need for adjustments at all. I put one in, and it stays where I put it. THE BATTERY IS BETTER THAN ADVERTISED. I only use one earbud at a time for safety reasons, so I use one until it starts telling me the batter is almost dead, and then I switch out. When you switch to the other one, you have to open the blue tooth menu on your phone and have it forget the one you are disconnecting and then repair the other one. Takes about 10 seconds literally. I'm just happy that you can use either one independently of the other one. The last pair I tried advertised that you could, but the right bud was the only one that actually connected to the phone. These TORO's are awesome. Work better than I expected to, and I will definitely shop with them again.GREAT PRODUCT TORO. I don't leave a lot of reviews, but when someone puts out a better product than the competition, and then sells if for about 60% of the crappier one, I like to say thanks.","我只吃了几天，但我把东西都塞进了绞衣架。我在俄亥俄州带着邮件，走路时用这些来听弗农・麦基的《圣经通读》。我已经让他们在倾盆大雨中出来了，他们干得很好。我不喜欢听音乐，但我讨厌听上去很便宜的耳机。我非常挑剔，所以我寄回了一套mpow BT耳塞，还有一个我记不清名字了。听起来都很便宜
这些有很深的低音，而且很响。我在一条繁忙的四车道上投递邮件，听布道完全没有问题。我总是在移动，从来没有一个工作是如此轻松。根本不需要调整。我放了一个，它就留在我放的地方。电池比广告上的好。出于安全考虑，我一次只使用一个耳塞，所以我使用一个耳塞，直到它开始告诉我击球手快死了，然后我就关机了
当你切换到另一个时，你必须打开手机上的蓝牙菜单，让它忘记你正在断开的那个，然后修理另一个。大约需要10秒。我很高兴你能独立使用其中一个。我试过的最后一对广告上说你可以，但真正连接到电话上的只有右花蕾。这些TORO真是太棒了。比我想象的要好，我一定会再和他们一起购物
伟大的产品托罗。我不会留下太多评论，但当有人拿出比竞争对手更好的产品，然后以大约60%的差劲价格卖出时，我想说声谢谢。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,85,5,"Great product for great price. I was worried about the fit, and it possibly falling out my ear.  But it fits perfectly! Very comfortable, and easy to use. I love the ease of automatic connecting and disconnecting as I remove it or put it back in the charging case. I've only had it 1 day,  but I used it at work, and in the shower.  Im not sure if it's possible,  but when using only 1 earbud,  its seems like it has to be the Right earbud,.. but maybe I have a mess with it more.Overall,  I highly recommend this product!","物美价廉。我很担心身体不适，可能会从耳朵里掉出来。但它很合身！非常舒适，使用方便。我喜欢在拆卸或放回充电箱时自动连接和断开的便利性。我只吃了一天，但我在工作和洗澡时都用过。我不确定是否有可能，但当只使用一个耳塞时，它似乎必须是正确的耳塞，。。但也许我有更多的麻烦
总的来说，我强烈推荐这个产品！
"
B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,78,5,"I purchased these headphones on a flash sale, so I got them at a reduced price. I figured, even if I don't like them, they weren't that much. I haven’t had them very long, but I’ve been surprisingly pleased with them.So far, I’ve used them mainly at my office to watch Netflix during my lunch break. I have on a couple occasions used them for a few hours without any problems with the batteries running out. I really like that the carrying case holds a reserve charge to recharge the headphones when put back in.I have never been able to comfortably wear a pair of Apple headphones, so I always avoid those kinds of earbuds. So far, they have been comfortable to wear. I haven’t had a chance to wear them to workout yet. So, I can’t speak to how well they stay in once I get moving. However, given the snugness of the fit with the current buds I have on them (the original pair that came attached), they feel pretty secure. I don’t foresee them coming out.One of the things that initially drew my attention to these headphones was the IPX8 rating. While I do swim quite a bit, I don’t think I will be attempting to swim with them though. Bluetooth doesn’t work well in water. However, I do have to work outside sometimes in the rain. So, it will be nice that I don’t have to quickly put them away.For the most part, I’m happy with the sound quality. I prefer more of a flat response, so I find them to be a little bass heavy. But that also means I was surprised at how much bass they actually put out. (Free tip: if you are using Spotify on your iPhone, there is an EQ feature so you can adjust the lower end if it’s too much.) Again, I’ve used them mostly for Netflix, so I haven’t noticed it as much. I was very surprised at how loud they can get.The sound quality of the mic is about what you’d expect from a pair of headphones. They work well enough to communicate. Just don’t expect to record vocals for your next platinum selling album with them.The Bluetooth is very quick to connect to my computer. They are usually connected by the time I can even get them in my ears. Even with the Bluetooth 5.0, there is some latency though. But, that is to be expected. It would be nice if they had aptX to help with that. However, given the low price, how new aptX is, being Bluetooth 5.0, and having an IPX8 rating, I can hardly expect that.I really like the case. It is somewhat bulky, but that’s the tradeoff to have a case that provides a reserve charge for your earbuds. I also liked that the cover is slightly transparent so I can see the battery level without having to open it. I also love that the case is equipped with Qi charging capabilities. I would say that the charging cable, measuring in at just over 12 inches, is really short. But, again, at this price, I can hardly fault them for not making it any longer. And, it’s not like you’re going to need them plugged in while you’re using them.Bottom line, I don’t think you’re going to find a better pair of earbuds with as many features at a better price.*** REVIEW UPDATE***I've now had these headphones for almost a year. I'm still pretty pleased with these headphones. Again, they're not an audiophile's dream headphone by any stretch of the imagination. But, they are ok sound quality. They produce good volume and they are comfortable to wear. For the most part, they stay in my ears pretty well. I need to readjust them sometimes but no more often than I would need to with any other headphones. I have not had the issue I have had with many other earbuds in the past of the tips coming off. I think this is mainly because I keep them in the case if I'm not wearing them.Occasionally, if they don't click into the case just right, they won't charge. However, the case also has a small red light to indicate that it's in the case and charging. So, I know right away if I need to reinsert or adjust the earbud. Also, occasionally, they don't connect properly to the device. However, all I need to do is pop them back in their case for a second. When I take them back out, they usually automatically connect to my device without any issues.I'm still quite pleased with the battery life of the earbuds themselves and the extra charge of the case. And being able to wirelessly charge the case is an awesome feature.What I haven't been as happy with is the audio quality of the mic. I've tried using it on a couple of occasions, but the person on the other end has had a hard time hearing me. So, I've given up using it for that. But, that's not my reason for choosing them, so it's not much of a concern for me.Overall, time-tested, I still give these headphones a good review.","这些耳机是我在特价时买的，所以我降价买的。我想，即使我不喜欢它们，它们也没那么多。我没吃多久，但我对它们感到意外的满意。到目前为止，我主要在办公室用它们在午休时间看Netflix。我有几次用了几个小时，电池没问题了
我真的很喜欢手机套里装着一个备用充电的耳机，我从来没能舒服地戴上一副苹果耳机，所以我总是避免戴那种耳塞。到目前为止，它们穿起来很舒服。我还没有机会穿它们去锻炼。所以，我不能说一旦我搬家他们住得有多好
然而，考虑到我现在戴在上面的花蕾（最初的那一对）和合身的感觉，它们感觉很安全。我没有预见到它们会出现，最初吸引我注意这些耳机的一个因素是IPX8的等级。虽然我经常游泳，但我想我不会和他们一起游泳。蓝牙在水中不太好用。不过，我有时在雨中也得在外面工作
所以，不用很快把它们收起来就好了。在很大程度上，我对音质很满意。我更喜欢平淡的反应，所以我觉得它们有点重低音。但这也意味着我很惊讶他们到底演奏了多少低音。（免费提示：如果你在iPhone上使用Spotify，有一个EQ功能，如果它太多的话，你可以调整低端。）再说一次，我主要是在Netflix上使用它们，所以我没有注意到太多
我很惊讶它们能发出这么大的声音。麦克风的音质和你对耳机的期望差不多。他们工作得很好，可以交流。只是别指望用它为你的下一张白金专辑录制人声。蓝牙可以很快连接到我的电脑。它们通常在我能听到它们的时候就已经连接起来了。即使使用蓝牙5.0，也有一些延迟。但是，这是意料之中的
如果他们有aptX来帮忙就好了。然而，考虑到价格低廉，新的aptX是如何，蓝牙5.0，并有IPX8的评级，我几乎无法预料，我真的很喜欢这个情况。这是有点笨重，但这是一个权衡，有一个案件，提供了一个备用费，你的耳塞。我也喜欢盖子是稍微透明的，这样我就可以看到电池电量而不必打开它。我也喜欢这个箱子有充气功能
我想说的是，充电电缆，测量在刚刚超过12英寸，是真的很短。但是，再说一次，以这个价格，我不能责怪他们不再生产了。而且，这并不是说你在使用耳机时需要插上电源。总之，我不认为你会找到一副更好的耳塞，它有更多的功能，价格也更便宜。***回顾一下最新情况**我已经用了将近一年了。我对这些耳机还是很满意的
再说一次，他们不是一个爱听音乐的人的梦想耳机的任何延伸的想象力。但是，它们的音质还可以。它们体积大，穿着舒适。在很大程度上，它们在我的耳朵里很好。有时我需要重新调整它们，但不会比其他耳机更频繁。在过去的耳塞脱落过程中，我没有遇到过其他耳塞的问题
我想这主要是因为如果我不穿的话，我会把它们放在箱子里。有时候，如果它们没有按对，就不会收费。不过，这个箱子也有一个小红灯，表示它在箱子里，正在充电。所以，我知道我是否需要重新插入或调整耳塞。此外，有时，它们无法正确连接到设备。不过，我要做的就是把它们放回箱子里
当我把它们拿出来的时候，它们通常会自动连接到我的设备上而不会有任何问题。我仍然对耳塞本身的电池寿命和外壳的额外充电感到非常满意。而且能够无线充电是一个很棒的功能，但我不太满意的是麦克风的音质。我试过几次用它，但另一端的人听不见我说话。所以，我已经放弃了
但是，这不是我选择耳机的原因，所以这对我来说并不是什么大问题。总的来说，经过时间的考验，我还是对这些耳机进行了很好的评价。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,77,5,"First thing I noticed was the look and feel of these earbuds give off a quality built product.The earbuds automatically turn on when removed from the case. After inserting them into my ear and rotating them into place, they felt very secure. Both earbuds proceed to tell you that they connect to each other as a pair and once syncd via Bluetooth to your phone, will say Device Connected. When you put the earbuds back in the case they automatically disconnect from your device and turn off to be charged.As far as sound, there is a great balance between bass and all around sound quality. If I had to rate the sound quality, I would say it’s between a skull candy bass earbuds and Dre Beats ear bud.The case itself being a charger is awesome and it has plenty of indicator lights showing you that it’s charging and how much battery life is in the case before it needs to be recharged.The Vendor was also very proactive in making sure everything was working properly and that there were no issues.Overall I’m very impressed with these earbuds at such a great price. Definitely worth the money.","我注意到的第一件事是这些耳塞的外观和感觉发出了一个高质量的产品。当耳塞从盒子里取出时，它会自动打开。将它们插入我的耳朵并旋转到位后，它们感到非常安全。两个耳塞都会继续告诉你它们是成对连接的，一旦通过蓝牙同步到你的手机上，就会说设备已连接
当你把耳塞放回手机壳时，耳塞会自动与你的设备断开，然后关机充电。就声音而言，低音和周围的音质之间有很大的平衡。如果我要给音质打分的话，我会说它介于骷髅糖低音耳塞和Dre Beats耳塞之间。这个手机壳本身就是一个充电器，它有很多指示灯，告诉你它正在充电，在需要充电前手机壳的电池寿命是多少
卖主也很主动，保证一切正常，没有问题，总之我对这些耳塞的价格很满意。绝对值这个钱。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: WHITE,48,1,"Bought these earbuds 2 weeks ago as my first experience with Bluetooth earbuds.Design is nice and it comes with a bunch of different tips so they can really fit into your ear, a plus for that.BUT, once I started listening to videos on my tablet, I noticed that the sound had a micro-second difference with the actual video. Thought it wasn't that bad.BUT, I tried with my app Duolingo and  not only it lagged but everytime they were saying something, I would miss the first or second word because of the bad connection.With just that, I was happy I didn't spend more money into that kinda product.BUT after just 2 weeks, the earbuds wouldn't connect anymore with my phone. Don't know why, but it would take 5 attempt to finally connect.On top of all that, reviews on this product are potentially fake. Once you register your product online for the warranty, you get an email asking you to rate 5 stars and in exchange, they send you a wireless charger.  So beware that from that 10 000 plus reviews, a lot of them were bought from the company itself.I returned them and bought another brand for cheaper....better sound, better connection.","两周前买了这些耳塞，作为我第一次使用蓝牙耳塞的体验。设计很好，而且有很多不同的窍门，这样耳塞才能真正适合你的耳朵，这是一个优势。但是，当我开始在平板电脑上听视频时，我注意到声音与实际的视频有微秒的差异。我觉得没那么糟
但是，我试着用我的应用程序Duolingo，不仅它落后了，而且每次他们说些什么，我都会因为连接不好而错过第一个或第二个词。仅凭这一点，我很高兴我没有在这种产品上花更多的钱。但仅仅两周后，耳塞就不再和我的手机连接了。不知道为什么，但最终连接需要5次尝试。除此之外，对该产品的评论可能是假的
一旦你在网上注册了产品的保修期，你就会收到一封电子邮件，要求你对5星级产品进行评级，作为交换，他们会给你发送一个无线充电器。所以要注意的是，从那10000多条评论中，有很多是从公司本身买来的，我把它们退了回来，买了另一个品牌，价格更便宜……更好的声音，更好的连接。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,53,2,"The sound quality is great. They stay in ear well when working out. The biggest down fall is that the left and right bud do not stay streaming at the same time. Audio on the left channel drops in and out when music is playing for the slightest reason. Head movement, phone movement, standinging still... it’s very annoying if your trying to get into a groove to have one ear bud just stop working for zero reason. For that reason alone I give it a 2 star because that is over all terrible quality for headphones.―-update―-The company reached out to me after I posted my original review offering to send me a new pair in exchange for a better review.

Unethical returning to sender and purchasing from a different vendor.","音质很好。他们在锻炼时能很好地保持听力。最大的落差是左右花蕾不同时流淌。当播放音乐时，左声道上的音频会因一点小的原因进出。头部移动，手机移动，静止不动。。。如果你想进入一个最佳状态去拥有一个耳塞，却无缘无故地停止工作，那就太烦人了
仅此一个原因，我就给了它一个2星级，因为耳机的质量太差了。―更新――在我发布了最初的评论后，公司联系我，提出给我寄一双新的，以换取更好的评论。我向他们保证，如果我收到一双工作鞋，我会改变我的评价。如果我先修改我的评论，他们只会给我一对替代品。退回寄件人并从其他供应商处购买是不道德的。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,53,3,"I really wanted to love these. The sound quality is excellent, they are super comfortable, and I loved the idea of being able to wirelessly charge them. However, they just don't hold up to use. The left earbud CONTINUOUSLY cuts in and out, especially when I am moving, which basically defeats the entire purpose of using them. It's so distracting. I've unpaired and repaired them several times, and even restarted my phone, all to no avail, I've only worn them three times and the problem just keeps getting worse. I was so happy with them at first that I threw away all the packaging and can't even return them. Very disappointing, especially for the price. :( Maybe you'll have better luck.[update 2/12/19] The seller reached out to me and offered to send me a new pair, which was wonderful, and I added one more star for their customer service (although they did send me way too many emails bugging me about updating my review).

All in all, these do not work for me.","我真的很想喜欢这些。音质非常好，非常舒适，我喜欢能够无线充电的想法。然而，他们只是不能坚持使用。左耳塞不断地进出，特别是当我移动时，这基本上破坏了使用它们的全部目的。太让人分心了

"
B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,46,1,"I bought a pair of these earlier this year and gave a 1 star review. This was mainly because the left earbud would constantly disconnect. The manufacturer told me I just got a defective pair, and that they would send a new pair if I was willing to delete my review. This seemed fair enough, and they quickly sent out a new pair once the review was deleted.Unfortunately, the new pair has the same issues as before, and I would recommend not buying these. The sound quality isn’t bad, but the non stop cutting out of the left earbud is a dealbreaker when it comes to wireless earbuds. I appreciate that they were willing to make this right, but 2 pairs of bad earbuds don’t help anyone. I highly recommend spending more on a better brand.","今年早些时候，我买了一双这样的鞋，并给了我一星级的评价。这主要是因为左耳塞会不断断开。制造商告诉我，我刚买了一双有缺陷的，如果我愿意删除我的评论，他们会寄一双新的。这似乎很公平，他们很快就发出了一个新的对一次审查被删除。不幸的是，新的对有同样的问题，我建议不要购买这些
音质还不错，但在无线耳机方面，不停地剪下左耳塞是一个突破。我很感激他们愿意纠正这一点，但两副坏耳塞对任何人都没有帮助。我强烈建议花更多的钱买一个更好的品牌。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,51,1,"I bought these to use while swimming laps after reading some positive reviews. After making a successful pairing with my iPhone, I jumped in the pool to get started with my workout. As soon as I took my first stroke both ear buds went dead. Then the right one came back to life and would only work when I took breaths and wasn’t in the water. I put the left ear bud on the deck and continued swimming with the right. After working intermittently throughout my workout it eventually completely shut down and hasn’t turned on since despite getting charged back up. Very disappointing so still on the lookout for a true pair of waterproof ear buds.","在阅读了一些正面的评论后，我买了这些在游泳圈使用。在和我的iPhone成功配对后，我跳进游泳池开始我的锻炼。我一中风，两个耳塞就都没了。然后那个人又复活了，只有在我呼吸时才工作，而不是在水里。我把左耳塞放在甲板上，继续右耳游泳
在我的整个训练间歇工作后，它最终完全关闭，并没有打开，尽管充电备份。非常令人失望，所以仍然在寻找一对真正的防水耳塞。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,44,1,"I purchased this product after reading through all the great reviews and great expectations. What I experienced with this product has been a mix bag.It pairs easily when removed from the charging case with the first device and with the left channel. The sound quality for music and movies from my iPad are pretty decent.I paired it with a total of 4 devices and have been using it for a about 6 months with a mixed experience.If there is only 1 device in the vicinity, then it takes an abnormally long time to pair with it, and it is constantly scanning for the other devices making a ping sound when unable to pair  (WHY??), causing a huge nuisance. So now, I have reset them both multiple times and have it paired with just one device. And still it keeps seeking the other missing device(s?). What a very strange ghostly behavior. And yes, resetting it multiple times seems to have minimal effect on this behavior.  So, I have wasted $50. It's not worth considering these as a alternative to any of name brands!!","在阅读了所有的好评和期望之后，我购买了这个产品。我对这个产品的体验是一个混合袋。当从充电箱中取出第一个设备和左侧通道时，它很容易配对。我用iPad制作的音乐和电影的音质相当不错，我一共用了4台设备，使用了大约6个月，体验好坏参半
如果附近只有一个设备，则配对需要异常长的时间，当无法配对时，它会不断扫描其他设备发出ping声（为什么？？）造成了巨大的麻烦。所以现在，我已经多次重置它们，并且只将它们与一个设备配对。它仍然在寻找另一个丢失的设备。多么奇怪的鬼魂行为。是的，多次重置似乎对这种行为的影响很小
所以，我浪费了50美元。不值得把这些当作任何名牌的替代品！！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,44,3,"Pro-Sound. For the earbud under $50 and compared with higher end earbuds, this is good enough for every day use. Well.. being really exact not every day use and it'll be explained in cons.-Battery Life. I had no issue on batter life on both earbuds and case. They are exactly as advertised I had no problem on battery running out during my use. To tell you the truth, max I've used this for was about 2 hours and a half.-Phone Calls. People I was talking to was able to hear background noise but they had no issue hearing me.-Holds steady in my ears. Comes with 4 different sizes so it should fit you find unless you have ear canal as big as a cave.Con-Connection. At home, fine. At shower, fine(IPX7 is true). Out for a walk/run, fine. Working out at the gym, disaster. Left ear is losing connection every second on and off. It kind of drives me crazy as I was focused on lifting. It sounds just fine only with right earbud on but hello this is a pair of earbud, not one single piece. I wanted to find a solution so I've had my wife to use it on crowded area and she had same issue.-Customer Support. I've advised them what issue I had. They asked me to reset the earbuds and I've done so and issue was still the same. I asked them what the next step is and they've gone silent until now. That being said, I decided to just return afterwards.Bottom Line is 3 Stars overall rating.1 Star on Material quality.5 Star on Sound quality.5 Star on Battery life.What turned me off was the connection of the left earbud.In case if anyone is wondering what functions this one have. Both right and left earbud have buttons that clicks and have same function. Power on/off, answer call, reject call, hang up, stop and play music. There is no rewind, fast forward, skip track, volume control. For the price point, I think it's fair.","专业音响。对于50美元以下的耳塞，与高端耳塞相比，这已经足够每天使用了。好。。不是每天都要用的，这会用cons来解释。-电池寿命。我对耳塞和手机壳的电池寿命都没意见。它们和广告上说的一样，我在使用过程中电池没问题。说实话，麦克斯，我用这个已经2个半小时了。-打电话
和我谈话的人能听到背景噪音，但他们听不到我的声音。―在我的耳朵里保持稳定。有4种不同的大小，所以它应该适合你找到，除非你有一个洞大耳道连接。在家，很好。淋浴时，可以（IPX7是真的）。出去散散步/跑步，好的。在健身房锻炼，灾难。左耳断断续续地失去联系。当我专注于举重时，这让我有点疯狂
只有戴上右耳塞听起来才好，但你好，这是一对耳塞，不是一块。我想找到一个解决方案，所以我让我妻子在拥挤的地方使用它，她也有同样的问题。-客户支持。我已经告诉他们我有什么问题。他们让我重新设置耳塞，我已经这样做了，问题仍然是一样的。我问他们下一步是什么，他们一直沉默到现在。也就是说，我决定之后再回来。底线是三星的总评分
材料质量1星，音质5星，电池续航时间5星，让我失去知觉的是左耳塞的连接，以防有人想知道这个耳塞有什么功能。左耳和右耳都有按钮，点击和具有相同的功能。打开/关闭电源，接听来电，拒绝来电，挂断电话，停止并播放音乐。没有倒带，快进，跳过音轨，音量控制。就价格而言，我认为是公平的。

I feel that if I actually run, instead if cleaning the house or taking a shower, that I will constantly have to adjust to make sure I don't lose one. My music sounds great but my friends say on phone calls, they can barely hear me or that I sound far away. It picks up all the background noises better than my voice. I'll give them a few more days before I complain or send them back. Probably wont make a difference.","到目前为止我只用过几次。我戴着最小的耳环，但还是不太合身。我觉得如果我真的跑步，而不是打扫房子或洗澡，我将不断调整，以确保我不会失去一个。我的音乐听起来很棒，但我的朋友们在电话里说，他们几乎听不到我的声音，或者说我的声音很遥远。它比我的声音能更好地接收所有背景噪音。我会再给他们几天时间，然后再投诉或把他们送回去

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,27,5,"I don't write reviews of every product that I order.  But these earbuds are truly great. I previously purchased the earlier model, TOZO T8 earbuds. They had really good sound, but the bluetooth connection was ""iffy"".  These new earbuds DO NOT have that problem at all. Now, I don't wear them swimming or in the shower (how long are your showers?), so I can't vouch for the waterproof quality. But I bought the new model earbuds because of the sound quality, comfort and convenience of the T8 model.  I can tell you that these earbuds, in my opinion, are even better for true sound and great range. They're comfortable and conveient to carry along in your pocket, purse, etc.  The battery in the recharge/storage case lasts FOREVER-- or at least it seems to.  And the recharge/storage case has nice blue LEDs to indicate how much charge is left in the case's battery-- this is really a very nice convenience.  Based on my pair of the TOZO T10 earbuds, I think you will really enjoy them, too.  So stop hesitating.  ORDER THEM!","我不会对我订购的每一件产品都写评论。但是这些耳塞真的很棒。我以前买过早期型号的TozoT8耳塞。他们的声音非常好，但蓝牙连接“不可靠”。这些新的耳塞根本没有这个问题。现在，我不穿它们游泳或洗澡（你的淋浴要多久？），所以我不能保证防水的质量。但是我买了新型号的耳塞，因为它的音质、舒适性和方便性
我可以告诉你，这些耳塞，在我看来，更适合真正的声音和伟大的范围。它们在口袋、钱包等处携带起来既舒适又方便。充电/储存箱中的电池可以永远使用――至少看起来是这样。而且，充电/存储箱有漂亮的蓝色LED指示灯，可以指示电池中还剩多少电量――这真是非常方便。根据我的一对TozoT10耳塞，我想你们也会喜欢的
所以别犹豫了。命令他们！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,20,4,"These are of an okay quality. The sound quality is just good, albeit a little grainy with heavy music. Batty life is also very short, only around 3-4 hours of active listening. This may seem sufficient but for a commuter, it's a nuisance having to recharge so frequently. They also don't fit comfortably in the ear, and are prone to slipping out (not suitable to the  gym). I've tried multiple sizes for the rubber and the earphones still fall out, sometimes in the middle of the street. The left earbud also chips out at random times, even when I'm being sedentary. That being said, these are not terrible earphones. The small size makes them very portable. If you want average sound quality and don't care about connectivity or battery life, these may be right for you. I will be returning as I don't believe they are worth the price.Update 3/21: The company reached out to me and offered a replacement that's a different model from the one shown here. I am increasing my review from 3  to 4 stars, in compliment of the customer service received.","这些质量不错。音质很好，虽然有点颗粒重音乐。巴蒂的寿命也很短，只有3-4个小时的积极聆听。这似乎已经足够了，但对于通勤者来说，如此频繁的充电是一件麻烦的事。它们在耳朵里也不舒服，容易滑倒（不适合去健身房）。我试过多种尺寸的橡胶，耳机还是掉出来的，有时在街中央
即使在我久坐的时候，左耳塞也会随机脱落。也就是说，这些耳机并不可怕。体积小，便于携带。如果你想要平均的音质，而不关心连接或电池寿命，这些可能适合你。我将返回，因为我不相信他们值得的价格。更新3/21：该公司与我联系，并提供了一个替代品，这是一个不同的模式，从这里显示

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,19,1,So this product lasts until just past the return window. Convenient. They worked perfectly fine for a month. Then over the last week have not held a charge and there is zero way to contact about this. The support is only for setting up. But they simple pretty peices of plastic and wires now. No matter how long I charge them plugged in or on the base. They work for 10 mins and then blink low and turn off almost instantly. Would be nice if I could get a replacement or just a refund so I can try a different brand. This. Sucks.,"所以这个产品一直持续到刚过退货窗口。方便。他们工作了整整一个月。然后在过去的一周里没有任何指控，也没有任何联系方式。支持只用于设置。但是现在他们用塑料和电线做的很简单。不管我给他们充电多长时间，插上电源还是在底座上。它们工作10分钟，然后低眨眼，几乎立即关闭

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: WHITE,12,3,"This is my second set of bluetooth earbuds. The sound quality in the TOZO T10 Bluetooth is quite good, better than in my other set. The bad: The connection gets broken if I turn my head sometimes or if I move my phone. That never happened with my other set. Also the battery seems to be very small and holds very few charges.But what I liked the least about the TOZO T10 is that after I purchased them I started getting emails from the seller offering me a wireless charger if I gave them a 5-star review (I was to send them proof that I had sent a review). That is so pathetic! I imagine that a lot of people took them up on the offer because there are so many 5-star reviews, but I don't think that should be allowed at Amazon.

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,11,1,"For sure I thought, “With 12k reviews, it should be GOOD”!  I wasn’t going to sit around and read through every single one of them.  Most reviews were 4 stars.Ordered a pair about 3-4 months ago.  Pairing it was straight forward and easy, no issues.  Once paired, noticed the left and right kept disconnecting from each other.  At first I thought it could’ve been due to having little to no reception or a bad connection.  So I uninstalled it and reinstalled, same thing.  I checked and verified that the case had charge, I didn’t charge it as the 3 blue LED indicators was lit up to show battery level ( way charged).  I thought maybe I needed to charge it (being a china product) so I let it sit plugged in for an hour.  Listened to it after fully charged and …. you guessed it.  Same thing.I already knew this one was definitely a defect but gave it the benefit of the doubt and continued testing/using it for the next week.  A week goes by, normal daily usage for about 30mins here and there throughout the day (at work and at the gym).  It did work a lot better at work but I had to stay perfectly still or very little to minimal head movement, gym usage was a def. no GO.  I got a hold of Amazon and a replacement was sent out.  Received my replacement, lo and behold, the same problem with the new replacement.  This time, when the replacement came, I made sure both the case and ear buds were fully charged prior to using it.The frustrating part was when I was using them at the gym till it starts to go fully crazy.  You sit there trying to tamper, disconnect/reconnect (multiple times) and trying to figure out how you can get it to work properly so you can continue your workout... but to no avail, then you have a bright idea as to use the right side by itself just to get some sort of music going while working out.  During this time you're constantly thinking, “hmm, maybe the left side might work now”, you throw the left side back into your ear and then the cycle repeats itself.  Your 1hr workout, turns into a 1hr and 15/30min workout because of this.It's been about 3-4 weeks now since I have not used it and its been collecting dust on my night stand!  Paper weight basically.  The return window has now closed so I'm stuck with it.  Overall on a positive note though, I do love the fact that these ear buds are capable of wireless bluetooth charging, have great sound and small enough that it won't fall off my ears (compared to airpods)... if only they WORK DAMN IT!!! Thought I found my perfect ear buds, but now, it’s back to using wired ear buds till I find better.","当然，我想，“有12千条评论，应该不错”！我不打算坐在那里把每一本都读一遍。大多数评论都是4颗星。3-4个月前订购了一对。配对很简单，没有问题。配对后，注意到左右两边不断地分离。一开始我以为这可能是因为几乎没有接收信号或者连接不好。所以我卸载并重新安装了它，同样的事情
我检查并确认箱子已经充电，我没有充电，因为3个蓝色LED指示灯亮起显示电池电量（3/4充电方式）。我想也许我需要充电（作为一个中国产品），所以我让它插上电源一个小时。在充满电后听了…。你猜对了。同样的事情。我已经知道这个肯定是一个缺陷，但是给了它一个怀疑的好处，并在下周继续测试/使用它
一周过去了，每天正常使用大约30分钟，在这里和那里一整天（在工作和健身房）。它确实在工作中做得更好，但我必须保持完美的静止或很少的头部运动，健身房的使用是一个定义。不走。我得到了一个亚马逊的电话，并派了一个替代者。接受了我的替代者，瞧，新的替代者也有同样的问题
这一次，当更换的时候，我确保在使用它之前箱子和耳塞都充满了电，令人沮丧的是当我在健身房使用它们时，直到它开始完全疯狂。你坐在那里试图篡改、断开连接/重新连接（多次），并试图找出如何使它正常工作，以便继续你的锻炼。。
但没用的是，你有一个聪明的想法，那就是在锻炼的时候用右手边来演奏某种音乐。在这段时间里，你一直在想，“嗯，也许左边现在可以工作了”，你把左边放回耳朵里，然后这个循环就会重复。你的1小时训练，因此变成了1小时15/30分钟的训练
我已经3-4个星期没用了，它一直在我的床头柜上积灰！纸张重量基本上。返回窗口现在已经关闭，所以我被卡住了。不过，总的来说，我确实喜欢这样一个事实：这些耳塞能够为无线蓝牙充电，声音很好，而且足够小，不会从我的耳朵上掉下来（与airpods相比）。。
如果他们能工作就好了该死的！！！我以为我找到了完美的耳塞，但现在，又回到了使用有线耳塞，直到我找到更好的。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,14,4,"****Update 1/24/20 (a year later)**** for the price, these are still great, but after a year of moderate use (maybe 30-60 minutes 5 days a week) my right earbud has ceased putting out any sound. It still connects to the left bud and my phone, but there's just no sound. I've run through TOZO's reset protocol a number of times to no avail. I'm pretty sure whatever warranty I had is expired, however, for 40 bucks I am very happy with the use I got out of these. Unfortunately, this is a prime example of the Commander Vimes' ""Boots Theory of Socioeconomic Unfairness."" I'll end up spending more on inexpensive earbuds that don't last than I would if I could spring for a set of expensive ones that do. Such is life. Not changing my star rating since I got a full year out of them. Should I expect more from budget buds?Original Review:I must start this out by saying that I am not an intensive user of earbuds/headphones. I don't typically wear and use them for hours on end, and I have almost never burned through a single charge on wireless headsets. I use them walking from my car to my office building and back. I don't use earbuds for phone calls and can't really speak to how well they work for that. What I can say is that, after using the Plantronics BackBeat GO 2 earbuds for a bit over two years, I was growing tired of the cord catching on my jacket collar and them pulling out of my ears every time I turned my head. I wanted to try some true wireless earbuds, but I wasn't going to pay a whole lot for them. I got the Tozo T10 because of decent reviews and a good price. I had read the 1- and 2-star reviews and understood the issues. I am also aware that bluetooth can be far from perfection. I was (and am) prepared for these not to work very well. I've been using them for the better part of a week and have to say I've been pleasantly surprised at how much I like them.Fit - this was a prime concern as I was initially worried about them flying out of my ears while just walking down the street. With 4 sizes of cushions, I experimented and settled on a size that works for me. They hang in there just fine and maintain a seal that usually provides good sound (occasionally my left channel gets wonky if it moves a bit, but I've had that trouble before and think it's my ear and not the earbud).Sound - sound is great. I typically just listen to podcasts, so sound quality isn't high on my list of requirements, but I did happen to put some music through them and it sounded good to me. I am not an audiophile or anything and don't get too worked up about sound quality, but I can say that for me, the sound is pretty damn good.Connection - jury's out on this and I'm still collecting evidence. So far it hasn't been bad. I did find when I connected to my Samsung tablet (to watch a movie at work) the earbuds got a bad connection due to conflict with a bluetooth keyboard also connected at the same time. But again that's typical of the bluetooth technology and not really a knock against the earbuds. I'm still concerned how it progresses. Many of the lower-starred reviews mentioned that connectivity issues appeared after a short time, so like I say, I'm keeping my ears open for any problems. Right now... they're working fine.Battery - as stated previously I really have no idea if these have the battery life advertised because I never wear them long enough to go through a single charge. I like that they recharge in the case and that it functions as a portable charger. It seems to hold a fair amount of charge. I suspect if you are a light user of headsets you'll be pleased with these.Waterproofing - I've used them in the shower once so far without issue. I haven't tried swimming with them and honestly probably won't. I can see using them in the shower more often though.Travel - I will say that due to the case being a charger it is necessarily a bit bulky. There will be no slipping this into your pants/jeans pockets and going about your day. But since the buds themselves are small and easy to misplace without it, keeping the case nearby is kind of important. It comes with a lanyard cord but I found that pretty useless. You can keep it in jacket pockets or a laptop bag/backpack. Pants pockets are going to get uncomfortable unless you're sporting cargo pants, and then you have to deal with the fact that you're wearing cargo pants.Warranty - the earbuds come with a 1-year limited warranty from Tozo. Seems like a good thing. We'll see if I ever have to use it.Summation - so far, so good. I expect if something adverse happens, I'll come back and update my review, but for right now I really do like the Tozo T10.Full disclosure... Tozo offered me a wireless charger for free. They asked for, but did not require, a review. They put no conditions for getting the charger, only to confirm the address that the earbuds were shipped to. They seem like a pretty good, customer-focused, company.","****更新1/24/20（一年后）****的价格，这些仍然是伟大的，但经过一年的适度使用（也许30-60分钟，每周5天），我的右耳塞已经停止发出任何声音。它仍然连接到左芽和我的手机，但没有声音。我已经看了很多遍TOZO的重置协议都没有用。我很确定我的保修期已经过了，但是，40块钱，我很高兴我能使用这些
不幸的是，这是维姆司令官“社会经济不公平的靴子理论”的一个典型例子，我最终会花更多的钱在便宜的耳塞上，如果我能买一套昂贵的耳塞的话，这种耳塞就不会持久了。这就是生活。自从我离开他们整整一年后就没有改变我的星级。我应该期待更多的预算芽？最初的评论：我必须首先说我不是一个耳塞/耳机的密集用户
我通常不会连续几个小时穿着和使用它们，而且我几乎从来没有在无线耳机上充电。我用它们从我的车走到我的办公楼然后回来。我不使用耳塞打电话，也不知道他们在这方面做得有多好
我能说的是，在使用Plantronics BackBeat GO 2耳塞两年多之后，我越来越厌倦了夹克领子上的绳索，每次我转过头，它们都会从我的耳朵里拔出来。我想试试真正的无线耳塞，但我不会花很多钱买它们。我得到了Tozo T10，因为它的评价不错，价格也不错。我已经阅读了1星和2星的评论，并理解这些问题。我也意识到蓝牙技术还远远不够完美
我已经（并且正在）为这些不太好的工作做好了准备。我已经用了一个星期了，不得不说我很惊喜我是多么喜欢它们。健康-这是我最担心的，因为我一开始担心它们会从我的耳朵里飞出来，而只是走在街上。有了4种尺寸的靠垫，我试验并确定了一种适合我的尺寸
它们很好地挂在那里，并保持一个通常能提供良好声音的密封（偶尔我的左声道如果移动一点会变得不稳定，但我以前也遇到过这种麻烦，认为是我的耳朵而不是耳塞）。声音很好。我通常只听播客，所以音质在我的要求列表中并不高，但我碰巧放了一些音乐，听起来不错
我不是一个爱听音乐的人或者其他什么人，对音质也不太感兴趣，但是我可以说，对我来说，音质非常好。连接-陪审团已经决定了，我还在收集证据。到目前为止还不错。我确实发现，当我连接到我的三星平板电脑（在工作时看电影）时，耳塞由于与同时连接的蓝牙键盘发生冲突而连接不良
但这又是典型的蓝牙技术，并不是真的打击耳塞。我还是很担心进展如何。许多较低星级的评论提到，连接问题出现后不久，所以就像我说的，我保持我的耳朵开放，为任何问题。马上。。。他们工作得很好。电池-如前所述，我真的不知道这些是否有电池寿命广告，因为我从来没有穿足够长的时间，通过一次充电
我喜欢在箱子里充电，而且它可以作为便携式充电器使用。它似乎有相当多的费用。我想如果你是一个轻用耳机的人，你会对这些很满意。防水-到目前为止，我在淋浴时使用过一次，没有问题。我没有试过和他们一起游泳，老实说可能不会。不过，我可以看到在淋浴时更经常使用他们。旅行-我会说，由于这个箱子是个充电器，所以一定有点笨重
不会把这个塞进你的裤子/牛仔裤口袋，然后继续你的一天。但由于花蕾本身很小，没有花蕾很容易错位，所以把花蕾放在附近是很重要的。它有一根系绳，但我发现那没用。你可以把它放在夹克口袋或笔记本包/背包里。裤子口袋会变得不舒服，除非你穿着运动裤，然后你必须处理你穿着运动裤的事实
保修-耳塞由Tozo提供1年的有限保修。好像是件好事。我们会看看我是否需要用它。总结-到目前为止，很好。我想如果有什么不好的事情发生，我会回来更新我的评论，但现在我真的很喜欢Tozo T10。完全披露。。。东佐免费给了我一个无线充电器。他们要求但不要求审查
他们没有提出获得充电器的条件，只是确认了耳塞被运送到的地址。他们看起来是一个很好的，以客户为中心的公司。

The left and right ear buds keep alternating connecting and disconnecting,  it's annoying as hell. And as soon as I place my phone in my pocket, the signal gets choppy. This was an absolute waste of money.","完全是废话。工作了两天就累坏了。愚蠢的我把盒子扔掉了，所以我回不来。左右耳塞不断交替连接和断开，真烦人。一旦我把手机放进口袋，信号就会变得不稳定。这简直是浪费钱。

The costumer service from this company is also amazing, however the product has some major problems. It took 3 tries for the company to send me a pair that worked. I'm happy with them now that I have it, but the quality of product can't be that good if they came in broke. Altogether it was a good purchase for the price, but only if you get a working pair.","我先从好的开始。这些产品的音质和价格基础都很好。这家公司的客户服务也很不错，但产品有一些大问题。公司花了三次努力才寄给我一双有效的。我现在很满意他们，但如果他们破产了，产品质量就不会那么好了。总的来说，这是一个很好的价格购买，但只有当你得到一个工作对。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,14,4,"I've been searching for a true pair of wireless headphones and ordered these. I run long distances and was tired of the cord with other options.There are many positives with these headphones. They sound good (for what they are), sync easily and have a good long charge.My problem with them is that they don't fit tight during my whole long distance run. After about two miles they start to loosen up in my ear. I'm confident this is due to sweating though as they stay in during my entire strength workouts without problems.These are great headphones and worth ordering unless you plan to use them ONLY for long distance running. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.","我一直在寻找一副真正的无线耳机，并订购了这些。我跑了很长的一段距离，厌倦了其他选择。这些耳机有很多优点。它们听起来很好，很容易同步，长距离充电也很好。我的问题是它们在我的整个长距离跑中不合身。大约走了两英里，我的耳朵开始松了
我相信这是由于出汗造成的，尽管他们在我的整个力量训练过程中没有问题。这些是很好的耳机，值得订购，除非你打算只用于长距离跑步。总的来说，我对这次购买很满意。

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,14,4,"UPDATE AT 30 DAYS: I’m really not a big review writer, but these headphones are definitely worth the price! The noise cancelling aspect is great. I sat on a 3 hour flight with a screaming baby, with the head phones in, no screaming! Wonderful! I now have the wireless charger and it works perfect too, and charges my iPhone. All in all, 30 days in, totally worth the $30.Good wireless headphones for the price. Worth the buy. Comfortable, like that the case recharged them in between every use even if it’s only a short period of time.I went on a 3 day trip, charged them before I left and they have still not died. Comfortable to wear and easy to pause your music or show. They connect to your Bluetooth as a pair or each individually which is great for me.ONLY reason I didn’t give 5 star rating, don’t expect to use them for a phone call, the mic is very low and people on the other end of the call have a hard time hearing you. By for headphones alone, great buy!","更新30天：我真的不是一个大的评论作家，但这些耳机绝对值得的价格！噪声抵消方面是伟大的。我坐了3个小时的飞机，抱着一个尖叫的婴儿，头上插着电话，没有尖叫！精彩的！我现在有了无线充电器，它也工作得很好，给我的iPhone充电。总之，30天内，完全值30美元。好的无线耳机的价格。值得购买
很舒服，就这样在每次使用之间，即使只是很短的一段时间，我都会给它们充电。我去旅行了3天，在离开之前给它们充电，它们还没有死。穿着舒适，易于暂停音乐或节目。它们可以成对或单独连接到您的蓝牙，这对我很好
我没有给五星级评分的唯一原因是，别指望用它们打电话，麦克风很低，电话那头的人很难听到你的声音。只买耳机，太好了！

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,10,3,"Update 2: one side doesn’t charge anymore after less than a year use. Dropping stars for durability.UPDATE: I was thoroughly happy that this earbud made it thru the 2 hr half marathon. I made sure it was fully charged and never tested it for this long. I got nervous at mile 12 when one side start to fade in and out. Not sure if it was the sweat or what but I notice that more often now even after a short run... for that losing a star.***I’m an avid runner. And been thru a whole host of headphones and was Leary of wireless “buds”. But I bought these as dual role of listening to music low profile at work (and for running).So far nonissue with sweat considerably snug and Decent noise cancelling (in that I don’t hear much else besides music) and pretty decent battery life... so far.Only issue? I gotten used to pairing one or both with my phone but it does take awhile to turnoff properly. Also, if u carry these in ur bag ur pocket in the car, careful because phone calls will be directed to your headphones. Also range is what you would typically expect of wireless/Bluetooth earbuds : ie up to 10-15 feet away from source","更新2：一方使用不到一年就不再收费。最新消息：我非常高兴这款耳塞能在2小时的半程马拉松中使用。我确定它已经充满电了，而且从来没有测试过这么长时间。我在12英里的时候紧张起来，因为一方开始慢慢地进出。不确定是不是汗水还是什么，但我注意到，现在，即使是在短跑之后。。。因为失去了一颗星我是一个狂热的赛跑者
通过一大堆耳机，对无线“花蕾”了如指掌。但我买这些是为了在工作中低调地听音乐（和跑步）的双重作用。到目前为止，不存在排汗的问题相当舒适和体面的噪音消除（因为除了音乐我听不到其他的声音）和相当体面的电池寿命。。。到目前为止。唯一的问题？我已经习惯了把一个或两个都和我的手机配对，但要想正常关机确实需要一段时间
另外，如果你把这些东西放在包里或口袋里，小心，因为电话会直接打到你的耳机上。此外，您通常对无线/蓝牙耳塞的期望范围是：即距离声源最多10-15英尺

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,13,1,"First off my fault for not looking at the battery life.  But barely 5 hrs and I didnt even play anything for some of that time.Then same issues as the other 1 star people.  Left ear cuts out, bluetooth cuts out constantly.  Its cuts out constantly if there is a little wind or if it's in your pocket.  Haven't tried to swim yet but the bluetooth is so weak I doubt that will work at all.  And no volume control!The only star it earned was because the sound quality was good at least.WAY OVER PRICED FOR WHAT YOU GET","首先是我没看电池的寿命。但仅仅5个小时，我甚至有一段时间没有玩任何东西。然后和其他的明星一样。左耳切断，蓝牙不断切断。如果有一点风或者在你口袋里，它就会不断地被风吹走。还没试过游泳，但蓝牙太弱了，我怀疑它是否能起作用。没有音量控制！它赢得的唯一一颗星星是因为它的音质至少很好

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,9,3,"update the company contacted me send me a ""new pair"" to change my review  nope these still suck for calls and the range sucks!!!!!I fully compared 3 Bluetooth headsets  this T 10 Headset,The OTium And 10 headset, and the LG 730 headset i use these for everything; driving, working out,  working in garage while making calls for all things listed.TOZO T10everything is as advertised except rangeThis headsetBuilt durable charging case is really niceThey feel comfortable in their ear. The sound quality seems pretty decentI can hear everything with good soundCall and listen to music and videos from both ears. For activities they stay in the ear they did not jostle around I do have rather large ears and was impressed by the fit.However these are not for calls I sounded very distant comparatively to the other two Bluetooth headphones. Yes there is limited background noiseBecause everything sounded so distant. The range is rather questionable walking throughout a houseStraight line full battery you might reach before potential that they advertise. I wouldn't consider these noise cancelingHowever they do fit so snuggly in the ear comfortably they just block the ambient  noise.  One thing I did not like about these is Because it blocks the ambient noise I have to pull one out of ear Anytime someone is talking to me or want to hear what's going on around me.  The battery life is probably the worst I have experienced. As advertised you will get about only three hours of music n video. You can charge them in the case at least twice though Before plugging the case in.  when battery drops so does range and clarity.  Bottom line if I did not need to make phone calls and I just want to listenTo music  or videos for only 3 hours This is a solid choice.  I did not test water resistance  just sweet resistance was fine thoughthese are not practical for meOtuIUM M 10These headsets are extremely lightweight Can barely tell they hanging from your ear. HoweverIf you have to pull out the right earbud due to the placement of the volume And multi function button they we'll hang down and pull on the back of your neck.  Sound for music and videoIs not as Crisp the T10 However the clarity for the Person you are callingIs clearWith that being said that they can hear every ounce of background noise. From banging cupboards to shutting drawers, Fans were humming in the background. They will pick up all ambient noise but still be able to hear you.  they do fine for working out / running lil flops from the button piece but not bad.the magnet catch is ok but not as awesome as they make it out to berange was as advertised was able to go to the far side of my house from phone  before distortion 3 walls 30 ft or so.so far this the one i will test further for durabilityLg 730This headset was my favorite go too, it  is an older technology and a little bulky but has never let me down.  sound quality and distance is extremely comparableTo the M 10.  Due to its bulkRunning and working out makes this extremely floppyIn bouncing around on your neck. The battery life completely outperformed the other two. The quality of call for others Is right in line with the M10.  I haveFully driven this in rainWorking outThrowing it aroundIt is extremely durable And the battery will last 6-8 hours.  It does have a manual on off switch,  And the earbuds are held magnetically intoThe neck piece.  Comparably for the cost730 doesn't tube too bad of a job for old technology and cost if you can get it under 20 bucks.I'm still searching for the perfect headsetFor multipurpose useAnd most importantlyQuality of callsFor the person on the other end of line. However out of these three.  the T10  will be returned and i will keep the other 2 for my needs","更新公司联系我发送给我一个“新的一对”来改变我的评论不这些仍然吸电话和范围吸！！！！！我比较了三款蓝牙耳机这是T 10耳机，OTium和10耳机，LG 730耳机我什么都用，开车，锻炼，在车库里工作，同时打电话给所有列出的东西。TOZO T10除了Range以外，一切都跟广告上说的一样这款耳机耐用的充电箱真的很好，它们穿着舒适耳朵
音质看起来很不错，我可以用很好的声音来听任何东西，还可以用两只耳朵听音乐和视频。他们呆在耳朵里的活动，他们没有挤来挤去，我的耳朵确实很大，我对它的合身性印象深刻，但是这些不是我和其他两个蓝牙耳机相比听起来很遥远的电话。是的，背景噪音有限，因为一切听起来都那么遥远
这一范围是相当可疑的走在整个房子直线满电池，你可能达到之前，他们的潜力广告。我不认为这些噪音可以抵消，因为它们确实很合耳，很舒服，只会挡住周围的噪音。有一件事我不喜欢，因为它能阻挡周围的噪音，每当有人跟我说话或想听到我周围发生的事情时，我必须把它从耳朵里拔出来
电池寿命可能是我经历过的最差的。如广告所示，你将只得到3小时的音乐和视频。你可以在箱子里充电至少两次，但在插上箱子之前。当电池电量下降时，范围和清晰度也会下降。如果我不需要打电话，只想听3个小时的音乐或视频，这是个不错的选择
我没有测试耐水性只是甜蜜的阻力是好的，虽然这些是不实际的，为meOtuIUM M 10这些耳机是非常轻，几乎不能分辨他们挂在你的耳朵。不过，如果由于音量和多功能按钮的放置，您必须拔出右耳塞，我们会垂下并拉到您的后颈
音乐和视频的声音不像T10那么清脆，但是你所称呼的人的清晰度很清楚，因为他们可以听到每一盎司的背景噪音。从敲打橱柜到关上抽屉，风扇在背景中嗡嗡作响。他们会收集所有的环境噪音，但仍然能够听到你。他们能很好地从纽扣上锻炼/运行lil-flops，但也不错
磁铁抓取是可以的，但不是像广告上说的那样可怕，在变形3墙30英尺左右之前，它可以从我家的另一边通过电话。到目前为止，这一个我将进一步测试耐久性LG 730这一耳机也是我最喜欢的一个，这是一项古老的技术，有点笨重，但从未让我失望。音质和音程与M 10极为相似
由于它的体积大，跑步和锻炼会使它在你的脖子上弹跳。电池寿命完全超过了另外两个。呼叫他人的质量与M10一致。我已经完全驾驶这在雨中工作抛出它周围是非常耐用的，电池将持续6-8小时。它有一个手动开关，耳塞被磁性地固定在颈部
相比之下，成本730对旧技术和成本来说都不算太差，如果你能在20美元以下买到的话。我仍在为另一端的人寻找一个多用途、最重要的通话质量的完美耳机。不管这三个。T10将被退回，我将保留另外2个以满足我的需要

B07J2Z5DBM,Color: BLACK,9,2,"I really wanted these to be the ones that worked since they didn't have a cord, but they were not at all good. I thought maybe changing the earbud tips they provide would make a difference but they don't. They just dangle in my ear, about to fall out and the sound sounds as though the earbud isn't in all the way. Then when I push the earbud in further, it is a larger part of the earbud that finally makes contact with my ear enough to hold it in. I just don't think that the part that holds the earbud in my ear is the part that is suppose to. So after having the earbuds in my ear where I think they should be so they don't fall out, I can't have them in longer than 30 to 45 minutes because they hurt my ear.Then the button on the earbud is not as easy to push as it should be so when you need to push it, you do so pretty hard which hurts your ear even more.The pairing and playback was actually pretty good. I wanted to use these between my phone and desktop at work and they worked how I thought they would. I get up to use the restroom and they unpair but when I come back they automatically pair with both devices. Switching from one device to the other is pretty decent also but listening to video messages in Marco Polo still had the skipping in the audio which really bothers me.So I returned these and found a pair of cheaper $20.95 bluetooth headphones with a wire and an around the ear type of earbud thinking that I'll just use them for working out but they are the best pair that I've found yet! They feel great in my ear, I don't notice the piece that wraps around me ear, they pair so easily with 2 devices at the same time, switching between the devices is seamless, the audio in the marco polo app is perfect with no skipping or pops. I would've paid $60 for a pair like these easily!","我真的很想这些是有效的，因为他们没有绳子，但他们一点也不好。我想也许改变他们提供的耳塞尖端会有不同的效果，但它们不会。它们只是在我的耳朵里晃来晃去，就要掉出来了，声音听起来好像耳塞并没有完全挡住。然后，当我把耳塞推得更远时，它是耳塞的一个更大的部分，它最终与我的耳朵接触到足够容纳它
我只是不认为把耳塞放在我耳朵里的那部分是应该的。所以在我的耳塞在我认为应该在的地方，这样耳塞就不会掉出来后，我不能在30到45分钟内把它放进去，因为它们会伤到我的耳朵。然后，当你需要按耳塞时，耳塞上的按钮就不那么容易按了，你做得太用力了，耳朵更疼了。配对和回放都很好
我想在工作时在手机和桌面之间使用它们，它们的工作原理是我想的那样。我起身去上厕所，它们就不通风了，但当我回来时，它们会自动与这两个设备配对。从一个设备切换到另一个设备也相当不错，但在马可波罗听视频信息时，音频仍有跳跃现象，这真的让我很困扰。所以我把这些东西退了回来，找到了一双便宜的20美元的
95个蓝牙耳机，一根电线和一个耳塞，我想我会用它们来锻炼，但它们是我找到的最好的一对！它们在我耳边感觉很棒，我没有注意到环绕在我耳边的那一块，它们很容易同时与两个设备配对，设备之间的切换是无缝的，马可波罗应用程序中的音频完美无瑕，没有跳跃或砰砰声。我愿意花60美元买一双这样的鞋！
